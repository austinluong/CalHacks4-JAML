However, the extent of the benefit depends on the caliber of the school and your individual aspirations and dedication.\n\nA Business School education is very highly regarded by potential employers, and candidates with a solid qualification from a respected institution gain an extremely valuable advantage in the job marketplace. A successful business qualification means you have drive, intelligence, are a team player and have the determination to succeed - all qualities that interviewers will find very compelling.\n\nBusiness Schools develop more than pure knowledge, they create strong leaders who inspire those around them and get results. A school that stands out will liberate and nurture the best qualities in their alumni: integrity, sincerity, innovation, discipline, courage and respect.\n\nWhen deciding what school is right for you, the best approach is to reach out to the schools on your shortlist and ask them detailed questions about their programs including what makes them effective and unique. Also ask them about their track record on placing graduates with jobs and what percentage of their alumni find jobs within three months of graduating. Inquire from the school as to what, from their perspective, it takes for a student to succeed with them. Their feedback will be instructive and help you decide whether their philosophy and approach are in line with yours. Supplement this by reaching out to current students and hearing their stories. Sites like LinkedIn are also handy barometers for how staff and students alike talk about their institution. The right Business School should make you feel comfortable and reassured by the feedback you get from all points of inquiry.\n\nWhen applying, remember your application letter will be one of thousands, so, if in addition to the expected academic achievements, it can be enhanced with details of community involvement, demonstrable leadership traits and experience and advanced expertise and reading in your chosen field, it has a much better chance of standing out.\n\nThe best and most successful students have clearly defined goals. Their Business School of choice assists them to achieve these goals, steering them safely and efficiently along their path. The skills learned at Business School have a universal application as we all need elements of marketing, finance, administration, operations and accounting expertise in our careers. However, to really realize the potential benefits on offer from this demanding area of study, the candidate should reflect not just about his/her day of graduation but where they want to be a year, three years, or a decade from now. Each school offers different specialties in the later stages of a business qualification, so it\u2019s important that these considerations are taken into account when making your choice.\n\nA Business School degree opens the door to a new world of greater opportunities; a wider selection of industries and a higher stratosphere for your career to rise to. Attending a Business School could also allow you to secure a prestigious internship and extend your network with other professionals from a variety of backgrounds and industries, all of whom have relevant, interesting takes on how to succeed in their field. In this way, and in many more, Business School provides numerous tools you need to add value to your resume and secure a better future.\n\nPostgraduate and Beyond\n\nCompleting a full time postgraduate education at Business School gives the motivated professional the opportunity to rejoin the work force with greater practical knowledge and implementable skills. This, coupled with their previously gained experience in the field, should allow them to get a number of rungs up the corporate ladder ahead of their peers. Part time students get the same benefits (although the program might take longer to complete). This mix of experience and enhanced strategic understanding is extremely attractive to companies who are constantly striving to compete in a competitive marketplace. This is why many employers send their best and brightest off to Business School to develop and refine their competitive edge.\n\nOne of the most sought-after higher business qualifications is a Master in Business Administration (MBA), due to its sheer versatility and career enhancing potential.\n\nMBA programs are designed to groom candidates for managerial positions and equip them with basic management knowledge and essential soft skills. The networking opportunities that can open up for you are one of the major advantages of studying for an MBA. Classmates and fellow students that are willing to put in the time and effort to gain their MBA, tend to be driven personalities with an eye on leadership roles, which means that they could be valuable contacts down the line. A school with a global student body population and alumni network also means that your networking reach could be very broad; conversely institutions concentrating on particular regions or industries closer to home could help you establish important relationships with future local leaders in your field.\n\nIf you are on the fence, get off it and start your research.

The islands are uninhabited except for a small Mexican naval presence and were named a World Heritage Site in 2016 for their unique biodiversity (the reserve is also the location for the photo that won the National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest in 2015 .\n\nNORTH AMERICA EUROPE ASIA north pacific Ocean AFRICA SOUTH AMERICA AUSTRALIA South pacific Ocean ANTARCTICA Niue, New Zealand Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, Chile Cape Horn and Diego Ram\u00edrez Islands, Chile NG STAFF\n\n\u201cWith the goal of guaranteeing maximum protection of this World Heritage Site, our national legislation\u2019s strongest conservation category will be used, and all forms of fishing will be prohibited,\u201d Del Mazo said in a statement. He also said that Mexico will not permit the construction of hotel facilities on the islands.\n\nPreviously, the islands had been protected by a small reserve that included only the waters up to six miles off the land. That left important feeding and migration areas for sharks, rays, whales, and other species in the path of fishermen\u2014who either target the species, often illegally, or catch them accidentally as bycatch.\n\nBut the new park is designed to protect critical habitat for those animals, as well as corals and other fish. No fishing, mining, or other intensive resource development will be allowed in the newly expanded reserve.\n\n'Giant Manta Rays Galore'\n\n\"This is the wildest place in tropical North America,\" says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas fact-finding expedition to the area in March 2016. \"It\u2019s one of the places where you can see the most giant manta rays and sharks on the planet.\"\n\nDuring the expedition, the team of more than a dozen scientists saw \"giant manta rays galore,\" says Sala. \"We saw lots of sharks, groupers, and tuna. It was a rare place of large fish, with biodiversity as if the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands had opened a branch in Mexico.\"\n\nOn land, the islands are home to many sea and land birds, endemic reptiles, and unique plants.\n\nWith a DeepSee submersible and remote dropcams, the Pristine Seas team also surveyed a ridge about 300 feet beneath the surface. There, they found \"a beautiful soft coral garden,\" says Sala, packed with corals, sea fans, sponges, crabs, and fish.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nWhen proposed, the reserve saw some opposition from fishermen, but fishing fleets used only a small part of the waters, says Sala. Of the entire Pacific range fished by Mexico's tuna fleet, only seven percent of their effort was directed in the waters of the newly expanded reserve, he says.\n\nAnd what's more, Mexico's fishermen should see their catches in waters outside the reserve increase, says Sala, due to spill-over of growing fish populations in the protected waters. That's exactly what happened around the Gal\u00e1pagos after fishing was restricted in 1998, turning former adversaries of the reserve into supporters.\n\nThe reserve should also increase the amount of dive tourism to the area, which is already a $15 million business. Boats often leave out of the popular resort destination Cabo San Lucas, a few hundred miles away.\n\nEach living manta ray is worth 57 times more to Mexico's economy through increased tourism than the money received by selling its body parts to Asia, Sala's team calculated.\n\nThe next step will be enforcement of the reserve's new boundaries. Illegal fishermen have been operating there with sophistication, sometimes using helicopters to spot for enforcement vessels.\n\nThe reserve is the newest marine park that Sala and his Pristine Seas initiative at National Geographic helped bring into being. Over the past few years, the project has helped governments around the world establish 17 new reserves, covering some two million square miles of ocean.", "summary": "These Giant Manta Rays Just Want to Hang OutThe Mexican government has announced the creation of a new marine reserve in the Pacific Ocean Thursday, the largest protected area of its kind in North America.\nAlejandro Del Mazo Maza, representing Mexico\u2019s National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, announced the massive expansion of the Revillagigedo marine park on October 5 at the Our Ocean conference in Malta.\n'Giant Manta Rays Galore'\"This is the wildest place in tropical North America,\" says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas fact-finding expedition to the area in March 2016.\n\"It\u2019s one of the places where you can see the most giant manta rays and sharks on the planet.\"\nDuring the expedition, the team of more than a dozen scientists saw \"giant manta rays galore,\" says Sala.", "score": 30}, {"source": "Newsweek", "title": "A Coding Career And You - Top Coding Schools 2017", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/insights/coding-career-and-you-top-coding-schools-2017", "top_image_url": null, "description": "Why Code?", "authors": null, "category": "general", "date": null, "text": "Why Code?\n\nCoding as an educational area and subsequent career path has gone through three distinct boom eras; initially in the early 80\u2019s when the first wave of affordable personal computers broke upon homes around the world and made programming accessible to the public, then came the dot-com bubble in the late 90\u2019s with entrepreneurs creating websites that made them millionaires, catching the attention of the students of the day.\n\nWe are now in the third era and all signs indicate that the industry has now matured to a point where its upward growth trajectory is assured. As a result of this, the career development opportunities for students who hold coding qualifications are greater than ever. In short, if you have ever nurtured an interest in creating software, mobile apps or websites, it has never been easier to get qualified and become part of one of the most rapidly growing and in-demand professions in the USA.\n\nIs this codings\u2019 Golden Age then? It might well be, consider the following*;\n\n63% of coding school attendees reported a salary increase 6 months after graduating (the average for 2016 was $22,700 - this was up $4,599 from 2015).\n\nSince 2014 the total coding schools market has more than tripled in size.\n\n2016 saw 68% of coding graduates working in IT within 6 months of graduation.\n\nCoding is becoming more diverse \u2013 with women now representing 43% of all graduates.\n\nThe number of coding grads more than doubled between 2014 and 2016.\n\n*Source switchup.org\n\nContributing to this, is the changing perception of coding as a field. Long gone are the days where computer programming was considered the preserve of anemic and socially awkward teenage boys operating from the dimly lit basement at their parents\u2019 house. These days being a \u2018geek\u2019 is cool. We probably have Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amongst others, to thank for that.\n\nCoded products are also reaching greater numbers of people in a more obvious and identifiable way. Smart phones are prevalent, with their huge universe of apps being the prime motivator behind their phenomenal growth and indispensable status in today\u2019s society. Social tools like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter have become vital channels within which we express ourselves and communicate with our peers. Finally, gaming has become a mainstream and gender neutral pastime, with game sales often out grossing blockbuster movies (together with their development budgets in many cases).\n\nSo, today\u2019s younger generation are growing up in an environment that lends the technology around them, and the people that work within it, in a completely different and more positive light.\n\nThis shift in perception has had the conventional educational community struggling to keep up with the surge of students looking to get into the coding field. Demand has been far outstripping supply, and specialized Coding Schools or \u2018Bootcamps\u2019 have sprung up to fill that void.\n\nWhat is a Coding School?\n\nCoding Schools could be described as the manifestation of a conviction held by a group of key industry insiders. This was that students who wanted to work in the field didn\u2019t need to go through the conventional educational cycle (usually entailing 3-4 years of theory heavy study, with the attendant costs). Instead, they could just learn the operational framework of coding and then jump right into a career, growing in experience and expertise within the working environment. It is probably fair to extrapolate that some of these industry figures were keen to get key positions filled more quickly than was possible at the time, but whatever the motivation, institutions dedicated to a high-intensity, efficient and focused path to qualification for would-be coders started springing up. Coding schools were born.\n\nCoding schools fully embrace the immersive learning philosophy. Their courses will typically last for just 12 weeks (but can vary from 6 to 28 weeks) and will suit those who prefer hands-on, project based learning and feel a sense of accomplishment from mastering a real-world concept. In addition to instructor-based learning, students are encouraged to explore concepts with others and on their own volition. Since students usually work in teams, much the same way as they would in the working world, participants learn first-hand the importance of effective communication and teamwork, as well as understanding the fundamentals and adopting best practices.\n\nCurriculum-wise, while the scope of syllabi can vary widely, traditional colleges and universities usually cover components such as Java, C++, Operating System Design, Advanced Mathematics and Algorithms to provide a more general study of theory and programming principles. Alternatively, coding schools concentrate on skill-building in anticipation of the latest real-world needs, focusing on web development and current languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and Python, as well as database systems such as MySQL, MariaDB, and MongoDB.\n\nHow should I choose the right Coding School for me?\n\nThe first two questions to ask yourself when starting down this path are:\n\nAm I looking to get into mobile, desktop or web development?\n\nWhere do I want to go in my career after I get qualified?\n\nThese decisions will influence the language you learn, as each of the main languages relate to specific coding applications. Different schools and programs will specialize in specific languages, so it is important to do your research thoroughly before making your decision.\n\nThe third question is - \u2018How do I want to schedule my study?\u2019 These are your options:\n\nThe immersive \u2018bootcamp\u2019. These typically run from two to seven months and are full time. It\u2019s not uncommon for students to put in 80 hour weeks, so attending one makes unique demands on your time that may not be compatible with the schedule of some potential students, especially if they are looking to fit their education around an existing job. The great advantage of a bootcamp is, of course, the speed that you can go from novice to qualified - they are without doubt the quickest way for an outsider to gain access to the industry.\n\n\n\nIf you are thinking of attending a bootcamp, the location can be a factor and students frequently attend camps in cities other than their own in pursuit of the best possible education. While the usual suspects offer the most variety of bootcamps (San Fran, Seattle, New York etc), there are bootcamps in over 70 US cities. Some students find a change in environment can serve to energize and focus them on their new discipline.\n\nThese typically run from two to seven months and are full time.

Students usually meet on a schedule of weekday nights or weekends and because of this, these schools cater to a more local student population. Students can expect to spend 6-15 hrs in classes and 10\u201315 hrs a week on other course related projects. This is a great option for students who have existing work commitments and want to schedule their education around these.

The most flexible format of all, but still necessitating some face-to-face interaction. Most students will still be expected to be available for (and benefit from) a physical meeting with a \u2018mentor\u2019 one or two days a week. Online programs still offer full and part time options and the course completion time varies considerably.\n\nOptions abound then.

On the day of Saint Anthony, the saint protector of animals and fire, the men of the village transform to become Mamuthones and Issohadores. Complementing one another like yin is to yang, mamuthones echo the darkness, while issohadores rope in the light.\n\nBonfires roar across not only the village, but all of Sardinia in observance of the holiday. One of the most popular festival days in the country, the occasion is meant to banish the cold chill of winter in exchange for the sweeter invitation of spring. It is on that day that the villagers of Mamoiada share their uniquely haunting procession of song, dance, and solemnity.\n\nThe stars of the show, the Mamuthones, represent the inhabitants of the kingdom of the dead, as well as the shepherd\u2019s strong connection between man and his beasts. They don anthropomorphic, grotesque masks created by local artisans\u2014accentuated by jutting features and slick black paint. Heavy copper cowbells sewn onto thick straps of leather hang tightly from their backs like tortoise shells, threatening to drag their bodies to the ground. Thin hoods of fabric drape over their heads, and darkly colored sheep pelts hide their shoulders, backs, and torsos.\n\nIn contrast, Issohadores parade around in red tunics and black bandoliers, a bell-adorned sash hanging across their bodies.\n\nThe procession begins in front of the largest church in the village. Led by an Issohadore, twelve Mamuthones begin their solemn, rhythmic pace forward. Lurching under the weight of up to 60 pounds of copper bells, they do not pay the public any attention. Lively issohadores twirl thin reed ropes, catching young women in the crowd. They continue like this from early afternoon until late evening, until each of the bonfires in the village have been reached.\n\nDating back over two thousand years, the true origin of the pre-Christian tradition is heavily disputed by scholars. Some argue that it dates back to the indigenous Nuragic civilization and was originally intended as a gesture of reverence for animals, and to serve as protection from evil spirits.\n\nFilmmaker Andrea Pecora feels a deep connection to these traditions thanks to Sardinian ancestry on his mother\u2019s side.

Here's what you need to know about Hurricane Nate 2017 and other potentially powerful storms:\n\nNATE'S PATH\n\nTropical Depression 19 became Tropical Storm Nate Thursday, when it savaged parts of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, killing at least 21 people there. As of Friday afternoon, the storm was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nForecasters predict the eye of the storm could hit just east of New Orleans by Saturday night or early Sunday, making it the third hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in six weeks. Hurricane warnings were announced for much of the northern Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nThe storm is likely to miss the areas most hard-hit by other recent hurricanes, from Puerto Rico to Houston. Still, there could be substantial damage and risk to life, if the storm continues to strengthen. (Read about how to survive in a natural disaster.)\n\nROLE OF WARMER WATER\n\nWaters over the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean remain very warm, a condition that helps hurricanes draw strength, upping wind speeds. Due to that warmth, this hurricane season was predicted to be more active than average.\n\n\"In short: atmospheric conditions [are] hurricane-friendly, and surface sea temperatures were warmer than usual,\" Michael Greshko reported for us recently.\n\n\"The Climate Prediction Center says that multiple conditions, such as a strong west African monsoon, have aligned to make the Caribbean Sea and part of the tropical Atlantic\u2014a storm-spawning area called the 'Main Development Region'\u2014particularly well-suited to hurricanes,\" Greshko wrote.\n\nAnd while scientists maintain that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change, two centuries of human fossil-fuel burning has altered temperatures just enough to almost certainly make this season's storms more powerful.\n\n\"In general, the way to think about it is: climate change has changed the environment that everything is happening in,\" Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, told National Geographic's Craig Welch. \"When you add in the climate's natural variability and then the right conditions come along, you can get a storm which is stronger than you might otherwise have expected.\"\n\nHOW HURRICANES WORK\n\nHurricanes form by drawing energy from warm ocean water and converting it into the mechanical energy of wind. Those that form in the Atlantic Basin\u2014which includes the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea\u2014are often spawned by late-summer thunderstorms that roll off the west coast of Africa near the Cabo Verde Islands.\n\nDue to the Earth's rotation, Atlantic hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise. They are one form of tropical cyclone, which also forms in the Pacific Ocean. In the western Pacific, these same storms are known as typhoons. However, storms that form in the Southern Hemisphere rotate clockwise. (See \"Typhoon, Hurricane, Cyclone: What's the Difference?\")\n\nAs hurricanes form, they can be slowed, weakened, or even stopped if they pass over cool enough water, if their updraft is blocked by upper-level winds, or if too much wind shear breaks them up. The complexity of these factors, as well as the shifting nature of the winds, means their exact paths and damage capability can be difficult to predict.", "summary": "Learn more how hurricanes form.\nTropical Storm Nate is likely to strengthen to Hurricane Nate over the next few days, and it is likely heading for the northern U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center warned Friday.\nHere's what you need to know about Hurricane Nate 2017 and other potentially powerful storms:NATE'S PATHTropical Depression 19 became Tropical Storm Nate Thursday, when it savaged parts of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, killing at least 21 people there.\nHurricane warnings were announced for much of the northern Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Florida.\nDue to the Earth's rotation, Atlantic hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise.", "score": 10}, {"source": "Newsweek", "title": "17 family Halloween movies for scaredy-cats to watch this month", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/family-friendly-halloween-movies-678005", "top_image_url": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/10/04/10-4-addams-family.jpg", "description": "Classics like \"Casper,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Beetlejuice\" and more bring the Halloween aesthetic with none of the nightmares.", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/AnnaMentaWriter/", "category": "general", "date": "5 hours ago", "text": "As fun as Halloween is when you\u2019re a kid, it's decidely not for parents.

After debuting in the top spot of the company\u2019s retail charts, things quickly spun out of control.\n\nIn all, the phone reportedly sold, at most, 35,000 units in its first 20 days \u2014 even more upsettingly for Amazon, the company swallowed a $170 million loss due to the phone\u2019s failure. That\u2019s the production budget for the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie \u2014 and they had a talking raccoon and Vin Diesel and stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s more than enough to put a company off making phones permanently. But given all that\u2019s happened in the industry in the three and a half years since the handset\u2019s release, maybe it\u2019s time for a reappraisal of the Fire Phone and what it meant for Amazon\u2019s hardware division.\n\nGiven the aftermath of the product\u2019s release, it\u2019s easy to forget that the Fire Phone actually wasn\u2019t all that poorly received by the media. There were some complaints about the on-board hardware (Amazon\u2019s never been especially interested in premium specs) and some of the device\u2019s implementation of features. But most seemed to agree that, at the very least, the product brought some compelling features to a smartphone market that was already starting to feel a little stale.\n\nThe Fire\u2019s standout feature was Dynamic Perspective \u2014 a quartet of cameras paired with a gyroscope, that brought a sort of parallax perspective to the phone\u2019s UI. Granted, the implementation was pretty silly \u2014 it was a lot of extra hardware with seemingly little return. But in 2017, the idea of multiple on-board cameras for depth sensing is becoming pretty standard \u2014 and the software applications for such a technology are much more numerous than they were three and a half years ago.\n\nA two-camera setting has quickly become industry standard for flagships. The early results functions are relatively simply, from added optical zoom to the bokeh Portrait Mode that every big manufacturer currently offers a take on. And then, of course, there\u2019s AR. With ARKit and ARCore out in the world, nearly every device maker is looking for a way to distinguish themselves and best serve the coming explosion of augmented reality apps.\n\nMany are already doing a decent job faking it with a single on-board camera, but offering a premium augmented reality experience requires solid depth sensing, and that\u2019s best served with the inclusion of multiple cameras. One can even make the argument that Amazon was forward-thinking in its decision to include this technology on the front-facing cameras.\n\nFrom higher-end selfies to Animojis on the iPhone X, smartphone makers view the little swath of real estate above the screen as one of the next key spots in the hardware spec battle. In both cases, it\u2019s clear that Amazon was ahead of many in its recognition that camera technology would become an increasingly important focus for smartphones. I suspect that the Fire Phone\u2019s camera set up would have continued to evolve in interesting ways, had the line been allowed to live.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Alexa. There\u2019s no question that the Fire Phone would have changed the math completely for Amazon\u2019s smart assistant. The gesture-based controls that came along with the phone\u2019s camera array point to a company looking for alternative input methods, and Amazon just happened to be developing its own voice assistant in house. Rolling out Alexa and the Echo at roughly the same time could have made it even more of a powerhouse than it is today.\n\nAs it stands, Alexa\u2019s mobile representation is, at best, anemic \u2014 and Google\u2019s been able to make up ground in the race by offering Assistant on the phone and in the home. The presence of Assistant and Siri on mobile devices have also made the AI more robust, integrating them more deeply into mobile operating systems and adding additional non-voice input methods for a more well-rounded offering. All the while, Amazon appears to consider Alexa almost exclusively a voice assistant.\n\nAI and machine learning are playing an increasingly important role on these devices, thanks in no small part to the proliferation of smart assistants. That shift is precisely what caused Google to declare the specs race over last week \u2014 it\u2019s something that could have served Amazon well, as the company has clearly put less of a focus on hardware versus software.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to make a defense for the company\u2019s stubborn insistence on making its own walled Android skins. But a quick look at Amazon\u2019s recent tablet offerings shows that the company has clearly learned that, when it comes to skinning operating systems, less is more. There\u2019s still plenty of room to integrate proprietary apps like Mayday without bogging down Android entirely.\n\nAll of these elements taken together could add up to a legitimately compelling mobile experience from a company that has no doubt learned lessons from the past, while continuing to build up usual potential mobile pieces like Alexa. If the rumors from earlier in the year are true, and the company is working on the Amazon Ice smartphone, the company may stand a fighting chance this time out.\n\nAmazon\u2019s hardware team has been thriving in the wake of the Echo\u2019s success, and if the company isn\u2019t too put off by past failures, the time seems right to give it another go.", "summary": "In all, the phone reportedly sold, at most, 35,000 units in its first 20 days \u2014 even more upsettingly for Amazon, the company swallowed a $170 million loss due to the phone\u2019s failure.\nGiven the aftermath of the product\u2019s release, it\u2019s easy to forget that the Fire Phone actually wasn\u2019t all that poorly received by the media.\nThere were some complaints about the on-board hardware (Amazon\u2019s never been especially interested in premium specs) and some of the device\u2019s implementation of features.\nI suspect that the Fire Phone\u2019s camera set up would have continued to evolve in interesting ways, had the line been allowed to live.\nThere\u2019s no question that the Fire Phone would have changed the math completely for Amazon\u2019s smart assistant.", "score": 10}, {"source": "ESPN", "title": "Love/Hate for Week 5", "url": "http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/TMRlovehate171005/fantasy-football-picks-sleepers-busts-week-5", "top_image_url": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1005%2Fr269354_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg", "description": "Matthew Berry expresses his gratefulness for uplifting emails and offers his fantasy advice for your Week 5 lineups.", "authors": null, "category": "sport", "date": "6 hours ago", "text": "I get email.\n\nEditor's Picks Week 5 fantasy football rankings Fantasy football rankings from Matthew Berry, Field Yates, Mike Clay, Eric Karabell and Tristan Cockcroft for Week 5 of the NFL season.\n\nBest, worst matchups at all fantasy positions Matchups are a driving force behind weekly lineup decisions in fantasy football.

Trust me, you weren't alone in losing because of the Kansas City D/ST on Monday night. It's team name suggestions, it's wanting a ruling on something that went down in their league, it's anonymous trolls, it's great pictures of fantasy loser punishments (those are my favorites), it's things I have missed on Twitter (I swear they send those every three minutes, it seems), it's letting me know about the bad advice that cost them a game, the playoffs or the league title, it's other people in the fantasy football industry asking for advice or an introduction or wanting to know if we have any openings at ESPN.

While our five-year age difference is hardly insurmountable, our lives have taken diverging paths. We were both raised as Orthodox Jews, but I abandoned a faith he embraced. He's chosen a career of altruism, working in a non-profit, while I chose one of selfishness, working in the entertainment industry. I watch football every Sunday, he can't tell you who was in last year's Super Bowl. We're as different as Tom Brady and Bryce Petty and like they probably do, we can go months without speaking.\n\nWhich is all to say he's probably the last person I'd think to share a fantasy football team with. Then a friend asked to take over an abandoned dynasty team in his league. Though this would be my fourth team, the request came the same day as yours to (again) invite someone new to fantasy this year. So I thought what the heck.\n\nI told the commissioner I'd take the team as long as I could co-own with my brother. Then I texted him congratulating him on his 50% stake in our new fantasy team and sent him links to some of your \"mediocre\" fantasy advice. I waited for him to object. He didn't. He said what the heck, too.\n\nFantasy isn't entirely unfamiliar to him, he's played fantasy baseball, but football is definitely not his forte. Since reading your first columns he's been asking a ton of questions. Some are frustrating (\"Why are we waiting to draft a kicker if they score a lot of points?\"), some are valid (\"You really think Cutler's worth the risk?\") and some are philosophical (\"Do we even need a defense?\") .\n\nBut the point is we've spoken more in the past week than in the previous six months.\n\nAs an avid downloader of the 06010 and someone familiar with the amount of negativity sent your way online, I figured you deserve to hear about the positive. -- Sam G\n\nWatch The Fantasy Show every weekday The Fantasy Show with Matthew Berry airs at 5 p.m. ET on ESPN2 every weekday. We will, however, be on ESPN on Mondays during the season.

My name is Paige (I'm a guy, just as a heads-up), I live in Maine and I've been downloading (not listening) to your podcast for 4-5 years. Love it! Been playing fantasy football since 1997-ish. My oldest daughter (also named Paige, I'm a father of three girls) is getting married in October 2017 to a guy I REALLY like. His name is Jeff and we bonded over the Fantasy Focus Football podcast! We'd both listen on the way home from work and text when we got home about the episode. I joined his family league and this year there was an opening in my dynasty league, so he's now in mine. And he got me a Yaters gonna Yate T-shirt for Christmas! Fantasy football brought me and my future son-in-law together and I couldn't be more thrilled. Thanks for all you do, Paige\n\nDear Matthew,\n\nThe day after last year's regular season ended, I tweeted a little thank you to you and two other analysts for your help throughout the season. You were the only one who responded. Not to disparage the other two, but your response was much appreciated, especially considering the amount of mentions you probably get every day. You also didn't know at the time whether I had won simple bragging rights or an enormous prize. Back to that in a second. The point is that you acknowledged me anyway and I thank you for it. When I met you at a book signing in NYC, you were equally as nice.\n\nThe league I won was a national season-long contest with a five-figure prize. As luck would have it, three weeks later I won a playoff contest on that same site for another five-figure prize. I don't say that to brag, but to mention that because of that success, I have been given an opportunity to write recently and I am really enjoying it. Even more meaningful was the fact that my victories allowed me to essentially pay for my wedding.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I moved in together two years ago and got engaged last June. We picked a date and a venue and were starting to work out the details when I realized we were in way over our heads financially. We both make enough to pay the bills, but apparently not enough to pay the bills and pay for a wedding. I remember arguing with her over my fantasy football entry fee last year and basically saying to her that fantasy was our only shot at having a real wedding. Though I honestly didn't believe at the time I could realistically beat almost a thousand other teams to win the grand prize, she trusted me enough to do so, and the rest is history. Thanks to fantasy football, we got married during Week 1 and I could not be more thrilled.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMick Ciallela\n\nMatthew Berry's Fantasy Life By fantasy players, for fantasy players. As a gift or just for yourself, gear up and show your pride about the game we all love. -- TMR\n\nHello Berry, I am a huge fan of the 06010 podcast. I am, for the first time, in a league where all members play seriously and I am loving it. I am 3 and 0. I just want to thank you for making fantasy more fun! Unfortunately, I am dealing with health issues and have been on sick leave from work for the last two months. Playing fantasy and listening to you on the show and podcast are helping me get through a difficult time in my life, so I wanted to thank you for that! Thanks, Brett, Ontario, Canada\n\nHey Mr. Berry: My mom has never really been around for me. But don't worry about that, my dad is a pretty good mom. Your new show is killing it. I love every second of it. I just wanted to let you know that when there are days that I'm sad I don't have her around that I now have [fantasy football] as an escape from all the stress and the sadness that surrounds my life and it's a great escape. Thank you Mr. Berry, I hope you continue to find happiness. Sincerely, Harrison, West Virginia\n\nThis has been just an awful, difficult week. Words are inadequate. At least any I could come up with. But where there is darkness, we look for light, and for me, I found it sifting through email. I can't tell you how much these emails meant for me to read. Because the thing I love about the game we all play -- the thing I have ALWAYS loved about the game we all play -- is that it's so much more than a game.\n\nThat it's family and friends and bonds with people we've known all our life and people we've never met. From all ages, all walks of life, from grandma to young kid, no matter where we are in life or what we believe in, there is a common language and a shared set of experiences that do not and cannot change. It's an escape to a world where everyone and everything is equal. Whether you are the CEO or just an intern, a grizzled veteran or just trying it for the first time, we are all sitting there, hoping they get it to our guy on the 1-yard line instead of play-action to a fullback no one has.\n\nI often say that fantasy football is life and in a small but important-to-me way, I was really glad to be reminded of that this week.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nQuarterbacks I love in Week 5\n\nDak Prescott is fifth in fantasy points among QBs this season, and he gets to face a Packers team against which he recorded his first career 3-TD game last season. AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: Dak has played the Packers twice. In the 2016 regular season, he was 18-for-27 for 247 yards and three scores. Then, in the playoffs he was 24-for-38 for 302 yards and another three scores. Aaron Rodgers & Co. should have no issue scoring here, which means Dak is going to have to keep up. Prescott has been terrific lately and you like facing Green Bay away from Lambeau (since the start of last season, opponents have completed 69 percent of passes and scored 28.9 points per game at home against them compared to 61.4 and 19.0 at Lambeau). And our friends at ESPN Chalk tell us the over/under in this game is one the highest of Week 5, so Prescott is locked in as a top-five play this week.\n\nJameis Winston, Buccaneers: Until further notice we are starting our skill players against the Patriots. You want stats? I got stats. They've allowed a 300-yard passer in all four games this season. No other team has allowed more than two. Opponents are completing passes against New England at the fifth-highest rate in the league, and the Patriots have given up 11 passing touchdowns, tied with the Titans for most in the league this season. They have also coughed up the most fantasy points to QBs this season. Winston's dropback percentage is 67 percent this season (a career high) and he's in the top 10 in pass attempts per game. Giddy up.\n\nBen Roethlisberger, Steelers: I get it. He's been bad. Less than 250 yards in three straight games, he's got Antonio Brown all mad at him and -- through four games -- is the 20th-best QB in fantasy. And then here comes Jacksonville, a defense that is allowing the fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks (just 6.3 a game). So maybe it's not surprising I was the only one to rank Big Ben inside my top 10. But while my own eyes tell me the Jags' defense is certainly improved this year, are we all sure they're world beaters? They've played the Tom Savage-led Texans in Week 1, the Titans, a completely lost Ravens offense in their first trip to London and the Jets. The only real QB they've faced is Marcus Mariota, and while he didn't have a huge game against them, he didn't need to because Tennessee handled them in a 37-16 pasting in which the Titans rushed 36 times for 179 yards (5.0 yards per carry) and three scores. I don't know, man. I understand everyone's concern, but since 2015, Big Ben is the second-best QB on a points-per-game basis when playing at home. Squeaky wheel gets the grease, so I bet Brown goes off in a game in which Ben reminds everyone what he can do. I'm in on Roethlisberger this week.\n\nOthers receiving votes: With Derek Carr and maybe Mariota out, plus a lot of big names on bye, you may be digging deep. So it's worth noting the Colts have allowed more than 15 fantasy points to every QB they've faced this season and they are better than you think against the run, so Brian Hoyer could be useful. So could Josh McCown against his former team, the Browns. They've given up the fourth-most fantasy points this season to opposing QBs and that list consists of the road version of Roethlisberger, the ghost of Joe Flacco, Jacoby Brissett and Andy Dalton. ... I'll downgrade Carson Palmer a bit if Fletcher Cox plays, but the Cardinals can't run and volume (Palmer leads the NFL with 45 pass attempts per game) will help against the Eagles' 30th-ranked pass defense.\n\nQuarterbacks I hate in Week 5\n\nWith the caveat that this week it's especially hard to \"hate\" any QB with a pulse, I'm not crazy about ...\n\nAlex Smith, Chiefs: The Texans' numbers against the pass look just OK overall on the season, but you know, what happens when you subtract Tom Brady? I mean, Smith has been terrific but, you know, he's not Tom Brady. Especially traveling on a short week. So, quarterbacks not named Tom Brady vs. the Texans this season? Just a 53.9 percent completion rate, 155.3 yards per game and only one touchdown. Now, they've faced Blake Bortles, Andy Dalton pre-Bill Lazor and half of Marcus Mariota, so it's also skewed the other way. But I think they play conservatively on the road and lean on Kareem Hunt here, especially since the Chiefs' defense is good, so I don't see Smith having to go nuts here either in what should be a low-scoring game. He's outside my top 15 this week.\n\nPhilip Rivers, Chargers: While playing in front of a hostile crowd is nothing new for Rivers this season, he is part of a West Coast team traveling east for a 1 p.m. game local time. Rivers has struggled this season when under pressure; he's just 27th in completion percentage when blitzed, plus two of his four interceptions came when blitzed. The Giants rank fifth in blitz percentage. With Keenan Allen likely to be held in check by Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, this feels like a heavy Melvin Gordon game, especially after he's been chirping to the press about wanting more work and the Giants allowing 142 rushing yards a game, fifth worst in the NFL.\n\nRunning backs I love in Week 5\n\nNot only has Todd Gurley been a major factor in the passing game, but his seven total touchdowns are one more than he had in all of 2016. Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire\n\nTodd Gurley, Rams: Just in case you were thinking of getting cute because it's Seattle, just stop. Gurley has the most touches from scrimmage in the league and only Le'Veon Bell has more carries than he does this season. The volume keeps him as an RB1 in a middle-of-the-pack matchup. That's right, middle of the pack. The Seahawks have allowed opposing RBs to average 5.12 yards per carry, fourth most in the league. That includes 3.17 yards before contact per carry, third most in the league. You're starting Gurley and I suspect he winds up with a low rostered rate in DFS tournaments.\n\nFrank Gore, Colts: The fact that Gore is facing his former team doesn't matter so much that his former team isn't very good. The 49ers have allowed the fourth-most points to opposing running backs this season, and Gore has gotten 67 percent of the Colts' carries the past three weeks. In a game the Colts should win (or at least be very competitive), Gore should get a lot of work in a plus matchup (Gore averaged 22.7 touches a game in the Colts' past seven wins).\n\nDuke Johnson Jr., Browns: I'm the highest on him and only one other ranker even has him inside the top 20 (PPR only), which is odd to me. Johnson is currently RB16 on the season and has increased his targets in each game, finishing with nine catches on 10 targets in Week 4. Part of the reason for this? No team in the NFL has passed more often than the Browns (73 percent of plays), and when they pass, they pass to Johnson, who has 28 targets this season, fourth most among running backs. Part of the reason the Browns have passed so much is they have been down big, but they should be more competitive with New York. That said, they don't have a ton of weapons (Johnson has twice as many catches as any other Brown this season ) and New York has allowed the ninth-most receptions in the league to opposing running backs, so yeah, expect them to get the ball in Johnson's hands a lot.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Alex Collins is averaging an insane 8.24 yards per carry this season, including 5.47 yards per carry between the tackles, which ranks fourth among qualified RBs. On the road and with the passing game struggling, expect the Ravens to lean on the run game once again against a Raiders squad that's allowed 4.38 yards per carry between the tackles this season, eighth most in the NFL. I also think Javorius Allen (the only runner with five-plus catches in three straight games) rebounds for a flex-worthy performance in PPR. ... Even with last week's disappointment, Tarik Cohen is the RB leader in receptions, with at least four catches in every game (only Christian McCaffrey can also say that among running backs). Considering opponents have completed the fourth-highest percentage of passes to running backs this year against the Vikings, I'm back on Cohen this week as a viable flex. ... You know I think that Arizona can't run and they can't block, which means a lot more dump-offs for Andre Ellington, who has led Arizona running backs in snaps the past three weeks.\n\nRunning backs I hate in Week 5\n\nLeGarrette Blount, Eagles: He certainly showed signs of life last week, and as of this writing (Wednesday night), Wendell Smallwood missed practice, so if Smallwood misses the game, you'd see more Corey Clement, but it would certainly increase Blount's chances of having success here, as I don't love them currently. Arizona has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in more than a year, since LeSean McCoy went for 110 yards in Week 3 of last season. Blount is not involved in the passing game, so you'll have to hope for a score, which is certainly possible, because it's not likely coming from yardage. Opposing RBs are averaging 2.98 yards per carry vs. the Cardinals this season, third fewest in the league.\n\nMarshawn Lynch, Raiders: Through four weeks this season, it's been a lot of lame \"Least Mode\" jokes, and sadly there's not a lot to come back with. And I am worried that continues into Week 5 against a good Ravens run defense. Yes, Le'Veon Bell went nuts last week, but it took him 39 touches to do so. I don't see Lynch getting anywhere close to that kind of volume. Among qualified running backs, Lynch is averaging the sixth-fewest yards per carry before first contact this season, and just a guess here, but I say Baltimore makes EJ Manuel prove it should back off the line on Sunday. Lynch is outside my top 20 this week in PPR, even on a bye week.\n\nWide receivers I love in Week 5\n\nChris Hogan, Patriots: Time for America's (soon to be?) favorite game show: Chris Hogan facts! He's second in NFL in red zone targets. He has as many red zone targets as Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola combined. He has accounted for one-third of the Patriots' red zone targets. He has four catches of 25-plus yards, tied with Brandin Cooks. He has more targets than any other Patriots wide receiver and just two fewer targets than Gronk. Since Week 2, he has the most fantasy points of any wide receiver in PPR scoring. He played football at Monmouth. Prior to that he played lacrosse at Penn State, where he met his now wife, who also played for the school. They are the parents of twins. You should start him without question.\n\nDespite the Dolphins' offensive struggles early on, DeVante Parker is averaging 15.7 PPR fantasy points per game. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nDeVante Parker, Dolphins: Am I really talking up a Dolphin after last week? Apparently. Part of it is volume. There are only five other receivers who have been targeted at least eight times in each of the past three weeks (Keenan Allen, Antonio Brown, DeAndre Hopkins, Michael Thomas and Mike Evans). And part of it is matchup. Facing a team that has given up a league-high 178 WR fantasy points means that volume should be productive. Parker is averaging the third-most deep targets (15-plus yards) per game this season, so he has a shot to get deep for one against a Tennessee team that already has been burned for three deep touchdown passes in four games.\n\nDeSean Jackson, Buccaneers: Come on New England. Show me something here. Show me that you are better than having me just pick everyone going against you. But for now, if you've got Patriots opponents, smoke 'em if you got 'em. D-Jax has at least six targets in every game this season for the Bucs, so they keep trying to get him the ball and on Thursday night, I say they connect for at least one big one.\n\nOthers receiving votes: If Marcus Mariota plays, I like Rishard Matthews' chances (at least seven targets or a touchdown in 14 of his past 16 games) against a Fins defense that is coming back from London and has allowed opponents to complete 75.7 percent of passes (NFL high) this season. ... Pierre Garcon has eight deep targets the past two weeks, a number that trails only Brandin Cooks, Stefon Diggs and Jaron Brown. They'll move him around enough to avoid Vontae Davis and exploit a Colts secondary that has coughed up a league-high 23 deep completions this season. ... Jaron Brown has been out there on nearly every snap the past two games (147 of 154) and had 12 targets last week (Larry Fitzgerald had seven). Even with John Brown getting healthier, I like Jaron to continue his play against an Eagles team allowing the most receptions, most receptions to WRs lined up outside (where he plays), receiving yards and second-most fantasy points to opposing WRs this season. ... Those who are desperate or looking for a cheap DFS play might consider Adam Humphries, who is second on the Buccaneers in targets, receptions and receiving yards this season and, you know, plays the Patriots.\n\nWide receivers I hate in Week 5\n\nAlshon Jeffery, Eagles: Marvin Jones Jr. had two catches for 37 yards ... in a game where the Lions went pass-heavy (42 attempts). T.Y. Hilton had four catches for 49 yards. Dez Bryant had two catches for 12 yards. And Pierre Garcon had four catches for 36 yards. These stats, of course, are what these receivers did against Patrick Peterson, for a total average of just three catches and 33.5 receiving yards. The same Patrick Peterson who will shadow Jeffery on Sunday. Now, Jones and Bryant did manage to score in those games, so hey, it's definitely possible. Especially if you can carry the entire defense with you the way Dez did. So if you're starting Jeffery, a touchdown isn't a nice to have, it's a must-have ... and that's dangerous. Carson Wentz has thrown multiple touchdown passes in just four of his past 16 games. Alshon has been up and down a bit this season, as he already has two games with fewer than 40 receiving yards and has yet to record a catch gaining 25-plus yards. He's outside my top 20 this week.\n\nSammy Watkins, Rams: He had the big performance in a standalone Week 3 game against the 49ers, but that's about it. He has totaled just eight catches (and more worrisome, just nine targets) for 105 yards in his other three games this season. Let me phrase that a little differently. While Jared Goff has produced top-10 numbers, Watkins has one -- count 'em, one -- finish as a top-30 receiver. I do think he will have a few more big games along the way this season, I just have a hard time seeing one of them coming against a Seahawks defense that ranks in the top 10 in both completion percentage and TD-INT ratio this season.\n\nAmari Cooper, Raiders: Too obvious? Well, Cooper was started in the majority of leagues last week when he was on the \"hate\" list in a next-to-impossible matchup, so I'm not taking anything for granted. Entering this game, Cooper ranks 83rd of 87 qualified receivers in reception percentage (42.9 percent) and is WR45 over his past 12 games behind injured guys like Julian Edelman and Cameron Meredith, as well as the retired Steve Smith Sr. No idea how you can have any confidence starting him until we see something, especially against a Ravens team that has given up the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers.\n\nTight ends I love in Week 5\n\nCharles Clay, Bills: Over the past eight games, he is the second-best tight end in fantasy and yet still available in 20 percent of leagues and not being started in about 40 percent of them. What more does this guy have to do? He has double-digit fantasy points in six of the past eight and is the fourth-best tight end in fantasy this season. Clay has at least six targets in three of his four games this season (only Zach Ertz has six-plus in all four games), and he gets 26 percent of his team's targets, the highest by any TE. More important, he gets 42 percent of his team's red zone targets, WAY higher than any other tight end. Cincy isn't the greatest matchup, but that's sort of the point. Charles Clay has reached must-start, set-and-forget territory.\n\nIn his first two games as a Jet, Austin Seferian-Jenkins has at least four catches in back-to-back games for the first time in his career. And now, he gets to face the TE-friendly Browns. Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAustin Seferian-Jenkins, Jets: Since returning in Week 3, ASJ is tied for the second-most targets on the team and has turned those into nine catches for 77 yards. A breakout is coming and odds say it's this week against the Browns. Cleveland rocks ... for opposing tight ends, that is. The Browns have allowed the most receptions, the third-most receiving yards, tied for the second-most receiving touchdowns and second-most points to opposing tight ends this season.\n\nEvan Engram, Giants: He is one of two tight ends with at least eight points in all four weeks this season and his targets have increased every week (only Ertz and Gronk have more targets among tight ends this season). Engram should get a lot of looks this week at home against a Chargers team that coughed up five catches for 98 yards to Denver's tight ends in their only other road game this season.\n\nOthers receiving votes:Benjamin Watson has caught 88.9 percent of his targets this season (all other Ravens: 57.8 percent) and has been far and away the team's most consistent fantasy pass-catcher (WR/TE) this season. The Raiders have been gashed by Vernon Davis and A.J. Derby the past two weeks, so if I'm playing a member of this Ravens passing game, it's Watson for me. ... Since I am mentioning all Buccaneers it seems, I might as well push my chips to the middle and say Cameron Brate has a good shot at TE1 value this week, as New England gives up the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends.\n\nTight ends I hate in Week 5\n\nJack Doyle, Colts: He is currently in the league's concussion protocol, so he may very well miss this game. But even if he plays, I'm not convinced he has a ton of success. In four games this season, the 49ers have allowed just 10 receptions for 77 yards and no TDs to tight ends, all of which are the fewest in the NFL. Doyle, who is coming off back-to-back games with fewer than 30 yards, is outside my top 10.\n\nJason Witten, Cowboys: Witten ran 36 routes in Week 4 and was targeted just twice. In fact, his 5.6 percent target rate was his second lowest in a game in our data set (past 10 seasons). I can't imagine using him in a 10-team league this week after the past two games and this week facing a Packers team that has allowed just 12 receptions for 106 yards to opposing TEs in four games this season (the second-fewest fantasy points allowed to opposing TEs).\n\nDefenses I like in Week 5\n\nBaltimore Ravens (at Oakland, 49 percent available); Philadelphia Eagles (vs. Arizona, 57 percent available); Oakland Raiders (vs. Baltimore, 79 percent available); Cincinnati Bengals (vs. Buffalo, 30 percent available).\n\nMatthew Berry, The Talented Mr. Roto, wishes he could respond to every email, but he reads them all.

The 3.0 update to the early alpha version of one of its major products is now in the hands of a select group of testers. If things go well, 3.0 could be in the hands of the general public by the end of this month. Here\u2019s what that means, and how you can get involved.\n\nWhat is Star Citizen?\n\nThe project to create Star Citizen is, in reality, an effort to create two massive AAA experiences simultaneously.\n\nThe first piece is a single-player game called Squadron 42. It is billed as the spiritual successor to the Wing Commander franchise, and will feature the acting talents of Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson as well as other top-shelf Hollywood talent. The first public showing of that single-player game was delayed one year ago this month, and no firm release date has been set since.\n\nThe second piece of Star Citizen is referred to as the \u201cpersistent universe,\u201d or PU. The vision for the PU, as expressed by CIG, is to create an online, multiplayer universe where many thousands of players can contribute to a vibrant virtual community. It is expected to include both player-versus-player and player-versus-environment combat, both on foot and from the cockpit of player-owned ships. It will have all the trappings of a modern MMO, including a player-influenced economy, player-controlled factions, bounty hunting, multi-crew ships, mining, tourism and trade.\n\nSo far, elements of the PU have been rolled out as four distinct modules. These include the Hangar Module (where players can view their ships and assorted virtual pre-order tchotchkes), Arena Commander (a PvP and PvE dogfighting experience), Star Marine (a tactical first-person shooter) and the Social Module (an early alpha of the persistent universe).\n\nIn the past, these modules have themselves been conflated with stand-alone games. But, in marketing materials circulated at this year\u2019s Gamescom, CIG now considers them to be \u201cadditional gameplay elements [which] double as standalone training environments.\u201d In truth, these four modules all contain elements that will be present in the final Star Citizen persistent universe.\n\nPrior to February 2016, Star Citizen was sold as a bundle that included all of the above. Since that time, CIG has elected to split the products up. Now consumers have the option of purchasing a pre-order of Squadron 42, or a pre-order of the PU and its associated modules.\n\nSo, in brief:\n\nThere are larger bundles, going all the way up to $15,000 \u2014 a so-called \u201ccompletionist\u201d bundle that is no longer sold on the website and only available by personal request. But, it\u2019s important to understand that all of this is being sold as a crowdfunding endeavor \u2014 sort of like a privately-run Kickstarter.\n\nWith more than $159 million raised so far, it just so happens that it\u2019s also the single most-funded crowdfunding campaign of any kind, on any platform, for any thing. Nevertheless, buyer beware, as returns so far have proven to be both challenging and controversial.\n\nWhat is 3.0?\n\nThe 3.0 update to the Star Citizen persistent universe is effectively a massive upgrade to the game\u2019s Social Module. It will add new gameplay systems to the product for the first time and dramatically expand the playable area.\n\nThe biggest selling point will be the procedurally generated moons, named Yela, Daymar and Cellin. The smallest of those moons will have a surface area of more than 851,000 square kilometers, which will dwarf the entire landmass of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. I know this because it\u2019s a fact that Chris Roberts likes to point out at least once during every public demo, usually when he\u2019s flying over a single mountainous valley where the entirety of Bethesda\u2019s game could fit comfortably.\n\nNot only are the moons in 3.0 big and luxurious, players will be able to seamlessly enter their atmosphere from orbit and fly around unimpeded by loading screens or transitions of any kind. In this way, Star Citizen will leap-frog its closest competitor, Elite: Dangerous. That game has allowed players to seamlessly land on planets since 2015, but so far that access has only been allowed on planets without an atmosphere. In Star Citizen, fans of the simulation spaceflight genre will be able to get out and smell the roses, so to speak, for the first time this generation.\n\nTo give 3.0 some diversity, CIG will also add a planet-like asteroid called Delamar. On it will be an abandoned mining facility called Levski, complete with all the trappings of a traditional MMO hub area. That includes missions, vendors and living quarters.\n\nIn additions to refinements for ground-based and ship-to-ship combat, 3.0 will include a rudimentary system of trade. CIG says that players will finally be able to use the cargo holds in their ships to buy and sell commodities.\n\nGrid View MISC Prospector mining ship on the surface of a rocky world.

These include the MISC Prospector mining ship and three vehicles used primarily for surface exploration, including the Drake Dragonfly (a two-person speederbike), the RSI Ursa Rover (a six-wheeled, Mako-like ground vehicle) and the Aoapa Nox hoverbike.\n\nOf course, to use these and other vehicles in-game you\u2019ll need to own access to them, which, in some instances, may require an additional purchase.\n\nThere are other improvements on the way in 3.0, including major enhancements to the game\u2019s user interface. Star Citizen uses a novel in-game holographic projection called MobiGlas, and much of that system will begin to come to life this time around. You can also expect enhancements to the game\u2019s netcode as well as graphical optimizations.\n\nIs it finished?\n\nIf you decide to take the dive into Star Citizen, you should know that the game is unfinished. Actually, it requires potential owners to re-conceptualize the meaning of the word \u201cunfinished.\u201d\n\nIn point of fact, the upcoming 3.0 update for the persistent universe \u2014 as I\u2019ve described it above \u2014 isn\u2019t even a proper alpha right now. It exists only as a pre-release candidate of an alpha, which is in the hands of only a small group of testers. When it drops, it will still be an alpha, which means bugs and significant gameplay impediments should be expected at nearly every turn.\n\nTo my knowledge, no one in the press has yet laid hands on a playable version of the single-player game called Squadron 42. What\u2019s interesting is that the entire Star Citizen project is in a state of radically open development, where individual milestones for multiple teams are shared in voluminous monthly updates, including huge blog posts and a whole host of videos on CIG\u2019s YouTube and Twitch channels.\n\nBut nowhere in all of that information is there a release window, and Chris Roberts himself patently refuses to pin a date, a month or even a year on anything he\u2019s making.\n\nAs far as the persistent universe goes, the current version is buggy to say the least. I enjoyed the time that I spent with the Arena Commander module in early 2015, but since then I\u2019ve been beset by all manner of bugs and instabilities in the Social Module. The last time that I logged in, about eight months ago, I fell through a bathroom door and was ejected into space without a pressure suit, where I quickly died.\n\nAfter that experience, I figured that I\u2019d put it aside for a while and stick to watching streamers enjoy it secondhand. But once 3.0 drops, I\u2019ll be right there alongside the rest of the community. My flight stick is ready to go.\n\nCIG tells Polygon that 3.0 could come as soon as the end of this month. Their goal is to launch it sometime near the fan convention, called CitizenCon, which will be held on Oct. 27. But they won\u2019t make any promises.", "summary": "The project to create Star Citizen is, in reality, an effort to create two massive AAA experiences simultaneously.\nPrior to February 2016, Star Citizen was sold as a bundle that included all of the above.\nThe 3.0 update to the Star Citizen persistent universe is effectively a massive upgrade to the game\u2019s Social Module.\nCloud Imperium GamesThe RSI Ursa Rover parks on a rocky world with one player sitting on the back fender.\nStar Citizen uses a novel in-game holographic projection called MobiGlas, and much of that system will begin to come to life this time around.", "score": 10}, {"source": "BBC Sport", "title": "Lewis Hamilton on title race and possibility of winning in Austin", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41542781", "top_image_url": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/121A8/production/_98225147_hamiltonepa.jpg", "description": "Lewis Hamilton says he is taking nothing for granted in the title fight despite opening a huge lead with victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.", "authors": "BBC Sport", "category": "sport", "date": "12 hours ago", "text": "Lewis Hamilton's win was the fourth of his career in Japan\n\nLewis Hamilton says he is taking nothing for granted in the title race despite opening a huge lead with victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nThe Mercedes driver leads Sebastian Vettel by 59 points after his Ferrari rival retired early in Suzuka.\n\n\"I just have to keep my head down and keep doing what I've been doing,\" Hamilton said. \"There are still 100 points available.\n\n\"We've still got to win the next four races.\"\n\nHamilton has taken four wins and a second place in the five races since Formula 1 returned from its summer break at the Belgian Grand Prix at the end of August.\n\nBy contrast, Vettel's bid has imploded, with a start-line crash in Singapore followed by engine issues affecting his races in Malaysia and Japan.\n\nHamilton will clinch the title if he wins the next race, the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, and Vettel is lower than fourth.\n\nHamilton said: \"Is it a purple patch?

If you\u2019d like to speculate wildly, feel free to consult Leto\u2019s past investments, which include Reddit, Houseparty and Zenefits.\n\nHe also pushed back on the idea that tech in particular is responsible for societal problems, arguing that \u201cthe entire fucking world is dark.\u201d He predicted that, much like the Industrial Revolution, the world will emerge on the other side of the tech boom with more jobs and prosperity, not less.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all obsessed with being productive, and we find new ways to dream,\u201d Leto said. \u201cIn order to accomplish those dreams, it takes the efforts of so many of us. I don\u2019t necessarily think that just because we\u2019re driving and we\u2019re not on horseback that there are less jobs now. The Industrial Revolution didn\u2019t lead to less jobs, it led to more jobs, so I think that probably will continue for some time.

More than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\n\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\n\n\"Two principal factors affect the size and strength of bores \u2026 the magnitude of the tidal range and the shape of the river at its estuary,\u201d said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at California's San Diego State University, in a 2005 interview with National Geographic.\n\nBarring extreme weather conditions, bores form only when a river\u2019s mouth is shallow, uniform, and resembles a funnel. Bore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\n\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver. As it encounters shallow water, the crest of the wave moves faster than its trough, sharpening its peak. Eventually, the wave breaks\u2014and a bore is born.\n\nSome tidal bores have global reputations for their beauty and destructive power. Each year, the U.K.\u2019s Severn River sees some 250 bores move upriver. The Lupar Benak bore in Sarawak, Malaysia, nearly drowned the British author Somerset Maugham during a 1949 visit. And as National Geographic reported in 2005, some bores in the Amazon have become tourist attractions, as thrill-seeking surfers try to ride them upriver.\n\nBut no bore is as well-known, or as large, as the Qiantang tidal bore, locally known as the \u201cSilver Dragon.\u201d Records for this tidal bore, which can be up to nine feet tall and travel up to 25 miles an hour, go back nearly 3,000 years. These records include some of the oldest written tide tables recovered in China.\n\nThe estuary\u2019s structure is textbook bore material. The Hangzhou Bay, into which the Qiantang river empties, is more than 60 miles across at its mouth, but it narrows to a gap less than 13 miles across where it meets the Qiantang. As high tides enter the bay, they\u2019re funneled in toward the river's mouth, spawning massive high tides and especially strong tidal bores.\n\nThese walls of water pack extraordinary power. Over the years, the Qiantang\u2019s bores have constructed a massive complex of sandbars with an estimated total volume of 42.5 billion cubic meters. That\u2019s enough sand to fill a box 2.6 miles to a side.", "summary": "On This River, the Moon Fights Earth's Gravity and WinsOn October 6, more than a hundred thousand tourists gathered on the banks of China\u2019s Qiantang river to witness an extraordinary sight: a wall of water several feet tall racing its way upriver.\nMore than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\nBore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver.", "score": 0}, {"source": "science", "title": "This Woman Saved the Americas From the Nazis", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker-nazi-spy-fagone.html", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/07/booktalk-code-friedman/elizebeth-and-william-F-098.jpg", "description": "Pioneering codebreaker Elizebeth Friedman, a poet and mother of two, smashed spy rings by solving secret messages.", "authors": "Simon Worrall", "category": "science", "date": "22 hours ago", "text": "View Images Elizebeth Friedman, here with her husband William, learned to crack codes when she took a job with an eccentric millionaire who was obsessed with Shakespeare.\n\nPhotograph Courtesy of the George C. Marshall Foundation, Lexington, Virginia.\n\nView Images Courtesy of HarperCollins\n\nElizebeth Friedman is probably not a name familiar to most of our readers. Introduce us to this remarkable woman\u2014and explain what drew you to her.\n\nWell, it\u2019s an amazing American story. A hundred years ago, a young woman in her early twenties became one of the greatest codebreakers America had ever seen. She taught herself how to solve secret messages without knowing the key. That\u2019s codebreaking. And she started from absolutely nothing.\n\nShe wasn't a mathematician. She was a poet. But she turned out to be a genius at solving these very difficult puzzles, and her solutions changed the 20th century. She caught gangsters and organized-crime kingpins during Prohibition. She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\n\nShe also helped to invent the modern science of secret writing\u2014cryptology\u2014that lies at the base of everything from government institutions like the NSA to the fluctuations of our daily online lives. Not bad for a Quaker girl from a small Indiana town! [Laughs]\n\nWe first meet Elizebeth at a mansion named Riverbank near Chicago that belonged to a notorious millionaire named George Fabyan. Paint a picture of this larger-than-life man\u2014and explain his obsession with Shakespeare.\n\nFabyan was a lot like William Randolph Hearst or Andrew Carnegie\u2014one of these incredibly wealthy Gilded Age multimillionaires who\u2019d made his fortune in the textiles industry. Unlike a lot of other Gilded Age rich men, Fabyan didn\u2019t go for lavish vacations on the French Riviera or collect art. He dreamed of discovering the secrets of nature. Although he was a high school drop-out, he saw himself as a great sponsor of science, somebody who used his fortune to bring together some of America\u2019s finest scientists and give them carte blanche to discover the secrets of the world.\n\nHe was very eccentric. He lived in a villa full of furniture that hung from the ceiling on chains. His couch and bed hung on chains. He was extremely suspicious of everyone around him. He kept a hive of honeybees inside his own personal house because he didn\u2019t trust them to make honey unless he surveilled them personally. [Laughs]\n\nOne of his obsessions was secret writing. He believed that Shakespeare wasn\u2019t the author of the famous plays, like Hamlet and Julius Caesar. He thought that they were written by one of Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries, the philosopher Francis Bacon.\n\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature. To do that he hired some of the world\u2019s most prominent Bacon and Shakespeare experts and brought them to Riverbank. That\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\n\nRelated: How Three Men You Probably Never Heard of Helped End WWII The British sailors boarded a sinking German U-boat, recovering vital Nazi documents and secret codebooks. This short animation by Mike Brookes is part of the Short Film Showcase. The filmmakers created the content presented, and the opinions expressed are their own, not those of National Geographic Partners.\n\nElizebeth cut her teeth as a codebreaker during Prohibition in the unlikely role of interdicting rumrunners. Set the scene for us\u2014and describe how she reacted to becoming a minor celebrity.\n\nAfter she left Riverbank in 1921, she moved to Washington and was soon recruited by the U.S. Treasury Department to fight illegal liquor smuggling that had grown because of Prohibition. Rumrunners used ships that could outrun the Coast Guard vessels to smuggle rum into the U.S. The Coast Guard was unable to stop them because the rumrunners got good at concealing their operations using coded radio messages. Thousands of these messages were piling up in the Coast Guard offices so they approached Elizebeth Friedman to get help reading them.\n\nBetween 1926-1930, she solved 20,000 smuggling messages per year in hundreds of different code systems. She did it all by hand with pencil and paper, before the era of computers. It was analog heroism.\n\nToward the end of the 1920s, she also began to testify in court against some of the biggest gangsters of the day. These criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages. She would go into court carrying her handbag, wearing a pink dress and hat with flower pins, and would explain to a jury exactly how she had intercepted these radio messages and decoded them.\n\nSome of these guys were very dangerous. She testified in one case in New Orleans against three lieutenants of Al Capone.\n\nAs a result, she became one of the most famous codebreakers in the world. She was known as the Lady Manhunter, or the Key Woman of the Keyman, \u201ckeyman\u201d being a nickname for a treasury agent, similar to G-Man in the FBI. She was on front pages from coast to coast and she hated all of it! [Laughs] She was a very modest person, and disdained what she later called the hero worship.\n\nThe publicity also created problems because codebreaking is normally a secret profession. You are revealing the secrets of people who are communicating secretly and the more you reveal about how you found those secrets, the easier you make it for people to conceal their future communications.\n\nView Images Elizebeth Friedman met Ian Fleming in the course of her intelligence work. He went on to write the James Bond novels.\n\nPhotograph by M. McKeown/Express/Getty\n\nToday, most codebreaking is done by computers. What sort of methods did Elizebeth have at her disposal?\n\nGreat question! She did everything with pencil and paper and a series of techniques, some of which had been around for hundreds of years and some she had to invent herself. Working with William Friedman, who later became her husband, in the early days of Riverbank, she created different approaches and attacks on secret messages that allowed her to pick apart garbled blocks of letters and arrange them into patterns that made sense.\n\nOver decades of practice, solving tens of thousands of messages every year, she developed an intuition, a way of thinking that made her one of the best in the world at seeing the shapes of words in a field of letters that nobody else could make sense of.\n\nHer achievements reached their peak in World War II in what came to be known as the \u201cinvisible war.\u201d Take us inside this murky world of espionage and counterintelligence.\n\nAfter Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and World War II began, the codebreaking team Elizabeth had built within the Coast Guard started to intercept and analyze messages that looked a lot like rumrunning messages but were actually being sent by Nazi spies. These spies were spreading into South America, which was a neutral continent then, and into the U.S. and Mexico. All of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.\n\nIn the process, she met figures from British intelligence. The British sent over a lot of young officers, who looked to all the world like they were just British chaps having a good time, but were actually spies. One was Ian Fleming, who would go on to write the James Bond novels. Another was a young Roald Dahl, who at that time was a handsome pilot in the RAF.\n\nShe also worked on the notorious Enigma codes. While Alan Turing was organizing large-scale attacks on enigma codes using algorithms and large electromechanical devices called bombes, Elizebeth was more narrowly focused on a couple of Enigma\u2019s systems being used by Nazi spies. That\u2019s how the notorious SS spy Johannes Siegfried Becker, nicknamed \u201cSargo,\u201d was encrypting reports he sent back from South America to Berlin.\n\nThe FBI considered Becker the most dangerous Nazi spy in the Western Hemisphere. He directed more than 50 agents from a base in Argentina, exchanging thousands of sensitive espionage reports with Germany, gathering information on U.S. and British military capabilities and instigating military coups in South American countries to swing governments toward the Nazis. Elizebeth\u2019s efforts led to the destruction of every Nazi spy network in South America, in particular the one run by \u201cSargo.\u201d\n\nYou write that, \u201cby any measure, Elizebeth was a great heroine of the Second World War.\u201d But her role was erased by J. Edgar Hoover. Explain what happened.\n\nThe FBI had responsibility for catching Nazi spies in South America and those were the networks that Elizebeth was tracking. So she was giving messages to the FBI and also providing them with materials so they could solve messages themselves. Without Elizebeth and her team, the FBI would have been completely lost.\n\nBut after the networks were destroyed toward the end of 1944, J. Edgar Hoover launched a publicity campaign to take credit for winning this invisible war, claiming that the FBI was solely responsible. He produced a film that was shown to U.S. troops called \u201cThe Battle of the United States,\u201d which portrayed the FBI as the main hero, and published articles in popular magazines about the FBI\u2019s great work. He did not credit Elizebeth or her team.\n\nTo this day historians wrongly praise Hoover and the FBI for achievements that were actually Elizebeth\u2019s. As a result, Americans have no idea that Elizebeth Friedman, a mother of two, was the great Nazi spy catcher of the war.\n\nThe National Security Agency hit the headlines with whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Describe the Friedmans role in its creation in 1952.\n\nElizabeth and William are the Adam and Eve of the NSA in the sense that they were present at the birth of U.S. codebreaking at Riverbank in 1916. Everything that happened afterward grew out of that time and place. Elizebeth also helped to invent the science that undergirds a lot of the NSA\u2019s work. But she had no direct role in the NSA\u2019s creation. It was her husband, William Friedman, who helped create it.\n\nThe Army codebreaking unit that William launched in the early 1930s, and led all through the war, decrypted Japanese cypher machines, leading to major U.S. victories. After the war that unit became absorbed into the agency that we now know as the NSA.\n\nWilliam was an NSA official for a number of years, until he began to believe that the NSA was collecting too much information and keeping too much of it classified. He became suspicious about the direction of an institution that, in many ways, he helped create, and eventually came to believe that the NSA\u2019s practices were a threat to democracy itself. In private letters, he made criticisms of the NSA that are reminiscent of Edward Snowden\u2019s criticisms decades later.\n\nYou write, \u201cThe world forgot about her and remembered him.\u201d Why do you think this was?\n\nSexism? [Laughs] Part of the reason she was forgotten after the war is because of secrecy. Her records were classified, stamped \u201cTop Secret Ultra,\u201d and carried off to what she called \u201cgovernment tombs.\u201d Thousands of pages of her decryptions and proof of everything she had done in the war were placed under lock and key in the National Archives until as late as the year 2000.\n\nAlong with many other American women who wrote codes during the war, she was told that if she ever spoke about it, even to her grandchildren, she would be prosecuted. So she didn\u2019t. As a result, for many years nobody knew what she had done in the war.\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.", "summary": "She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature.\nThat\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\nThese criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages.\nAll of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.", "score": 0}, {"source": "science", "title": "These Giant Invasive Beasts May Actually Be Good for the Planet", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/invasive-species-camels-horses-hippos-extinction-environment.html", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/06/invasive-species/05-invasive-animals-NationalGeographic_1737689.jpg", "description": "Feral horses or camels may not &quot;belong&quot; where we put them, a new study says, but they're keeping the species wild and helping the ecosystem.", "authors": "Emma Marris", "category": "science", "date": "10 hours ago", "text": "View Images Australia has some 300,000 feral camels, whose ancestors were imported from the Middle East as pack animals in the 19th century.\n\nPhotograph by Bill Hatcher, National Geographic Creative\n\nWild horses grazing on the Western range, dromedary camels roaming the Australian outback, hippos lounging in Colombian lakes\u2014they all have two things in common: They\u2019re very large herbivores, and they\u2019re on the \u201cwrong\u201d continent. They were imported from their native range by people\u2014in the case of the hippos, by the now-deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose private zoo the beasts escaped from.\n\nThe conventional view among ecologists is that these species and other expatriate herbivores are an ecological problem. A new study takes issue with that, arguing that we should welcome them in their new ranges. According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\n\nOf the 76 herbivores in the world that weigh more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds), 22 have substantial populations outside their native ranges, according to ecologist Erick Lundgren of Arizona State University and his colleagues. Of those 22, half are threatened or extinct in their native ranges.\n\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species. The aurochs that humans once painted on caves, for example, and later domesticated into modern cattle, is long since extinct\u2014but feral cattle run wild from Hawaii to Hong Kong.\n\nThough every population has its own story\u2014Pablo Escobar used his hippos to show off\u2014there are common themes. \u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\n\nDrug Kingpin Pablo Escobar\u2019s Hippos Are Alive and Well\n\nThe question now is how to think and what to do about them. Lundgren and co-author Arian Wallach, an ecologist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, say these animals are often bringing grazing back to landscapes where it has been missing. By grazing tree seedlings, large herbivores keep grasslands from turning into forest and reduce fire risk. By grazing in one place and pooping in another, they move nutrients around.\n\nIn Arizona Lundgren has even watched wild burros\u2014whose ancestors hail from North Africa\u2014dig water holes that are then used by coyotes, javelinas, bighorn sheep, and plants. But to a lot of Arizonans these days, the burros are pests that amble around town as if they own the place, and wreck cars by allowing themselves to get hit.\n\nThey Can\u2019t Go Home Again\n\nMany conservationists have argued that such wayward animals should be \u201cput back\u201d in their native habitats. But that often isn\u2019t possible, Wallach says. The one-humped dromedary camel is an example.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why these animals went extinct in the Middle East in the first place,\u201d she says. Wild camels were presumably hunted and domesticated out of existence, and today there\u2019s no obvious place in the Middle East or North Africa where they\u2019d be safe for a massive reintroduction effort. Besides, Wallach points out, although we tend to think that the dromedary \u201cbelongs\u201d in the Middle East\u2014because that is where humans first encountered and domesticated it\u2014the species actually evolved millions of years earlier in North America.\n\nToday, Wallach says, \u201ccamels are best suited to Australia,\u201d where they were introduced in the 19th century, and where there are now some 300,000 dromedaries wandering in the desert. Part of the reason she and her colleagues conducted their survey was to get people to realize that these non-native populations are often large and ecologically influential.\n\nWallach got the idea while looking at a map created by co-author William Ripple, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The map showed where large herbivores live on Earth, but Australia was completely empty\u2014despite the fact that, in addition to the world\u2019s only population of wild dromedaries, it currently hosts seven other introduced species of large herbivore, including donkeys, water buffalo, horses, the endangered banteng from Southeast Asia, and the vulnerable sambar deer, from India.\n\nBecause they aren\u2019t native, they weren\u2019t on Ripple\u2019s original map. This selective vision is widespread in ecology, and in practice it means that little is known about these populations. Even now, with the study complete, Lundgren is hearing about new populations with some regularity. \u201cI just found a new species that we missed,\u201d he says. \u201cGiant eland in Cuba. There\u2019s like 1,000.\u201d This uncommonly beautiful antelope is vulnerable to extinction in its native Africa.\n\n\u201cThese animals exist,\u201d says Lundgren. \u201cFor many of them the introduced home is the home they know more than anywhere else. We would spend a great deal of energy and time killing these animals if we were to try to go back to some pure historic baseline.\u201d Instead, he thinks it better to \u201copen our eyes to a wonder that we so often ignore and celebrate these animals.\u201d\n\nCelebrate Camels? Please.\n\nOther ecologists are not yet breaking out the champagne. Daniel Simberloff of the University of Tennessee studies the impact of non-native species on ecosystems, and he says Lundgren and his colleagues have unfairly stacked the deck, reporting only the positive impacts of the invasive herbivores and ignoring the problems they cause.\n\n\u201cCamels, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Simberloff says. \u201cThere is an entire book and many papers about the many inimical impacts\u2014ecological as well as economic and social, of feral camels.\u201d Indeed, studies suggest that the desert wanderers damage and foul water holes and springs, including those that have cultural significance to Aboriginal people. The taciturn beasts have also locally wiped out tasty plants such as the quandong, a delicious fruit in the sandalwood family.\n\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under. But \u201cthey don\u2019t have to roam over half of Australia.\u201d\n\nView Images Wild horses\u2014these are in the McCullough Peaks Herd Management Area near Cody, Wyoming\u2014are a contentious issue in the American West.\n\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic Creative\n\nOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory. But they say the devil is\u2014as always in ecology\u2014in the details. Eric Beever, a United States Geological Survey ecologist based in Bozeman, Montana, says that while some grazing on a landscape might be great, too much can reduce the diversity of other flora and fauna, from small mammals to plants. Without predators keeping these out-of-place herbivores in check, species like wild horses can becomes a real problem in the American West.\n\n\u201cI love riding horses,\u201d Beever says. \u201cIn a romantic sense it is a beautiful thing to watch them; from an ecologist\u2019s perspective\u2026.\u201d he trails off, then quotes ecologist Aldo Leopold. \u201cOne of the penalties of an ecological education,\u201d Leopold once wrote, \u201cis that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen.\u201d For Beever, the intensive grazing of wild horses\u2014though it\u2019s far outweighed by the impact of domestic cattle\u2014is one such wound.\n\nWallach, who isn\u2019t a layperson, doesn\u2019t see it that way. The landscape that so many ecologists associate with natural health in western North America isn\u2019t natural, she says. It was actually created by the extinction, starting more than 10,000 years ago, of the many large animals that lived in North America during the Pleistocene ice ages. Human hunters were the main culprit, and the result was a greener, woodsier world with less grazing in it.\n\n\u201cThe concept of \u2018overgrazing\u2019 tells us about ourselves,\u201d Wallach says. \u201cWhen one says animals are overgrazing, one is really saying \u2018I feel that this landscape has a grazing impact that I don\u2019t like.\u2019\u201d\n\nNext: Invasive Elephants?\n\nCornell ecologist Harry Greene, for one, is willing to go beyond celebrating the herbivores we\u2019ve already introduced. He thinks we should consider introducing more, as proxies for the Pleistocene animals that went extinct.\n\nNorth America used to host a lot of mammoths, and burros, wild horses, and cattle don\u2019t exactly replace these enormous browsers. Elephants might, though\u2014and Greene proposes we do an experiment to see how they would interact with a modern American ecosystem. \u201cWe have over 100 Asian elephants in the country now, and there is increasing sentiment to get them out of zoos,\u201d he says. Why not create a controlled herd, behind fences, and study them?\n\nThreatened by habitat loss and poaching in Africa and Asia, elephants might one day, in this view, find refuge in America. \u201cIf the only elephants left on earth were a North American herd that started with zoo animals, that would still be better than no elephants left on Earth at all,\u201d Greene says.", "summary": "According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species.\n\u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under.\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic CreativeOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory.", "score": 0}, {"source": "science", "title": "Pictures Reveal the \u2018Microvillages\u2019 of a Divided Catalonia", "url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/10/spain-catalonia-rural-vote-independence.html", "top_image_url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/photography/PROOF/2017/October/rural-catalonia/02-rural-catalonia.jpg", "description": "Decades of national tension lead to long-lasting implications for Spain's future.", "authors": "Austa Somvichian-Clausen", "category": "science", "date": "10 hours ago", "text": "View Images Arres is a hamlet of 67 people in Catalonia, near France.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer\n\nThe northeastern corner of Spain is home to the semi-autonomous region of Catalonia, whose people have long regarded themselves not as a region, but as a nation.

The vote was once again declared illegal by the central Spanish government in Madrid, and many voters had their ballots confiscated by police.

He says the central government\u2019s heavy-handed response this week is reminiscent of such past conflict.\n\nView Images A stream of wild pig blood and water trickles down the street in Alfara de Carles.

Catalonia\u2019s separatist movement has raised questions about the future of Barcelona\u2019s popular football club, and if it will possibly exit Spain\u2019s national football league, La Liga. The team has currently won 24 La Liga titles.\n\nMicrocatalonia\n\nCatalan photographer Edu Bayer and journalist Marc Serena made the conscious decision to pen their book, Microcatalonia: a journey through the tiniest villages, in their native language of Catalan.\n\n\u201cDuring the civil war, the use of our native language was repressed. Catalan was banned from being spoken, and from being studied in school,\u201d says Bayer. \u201cThe consequences of the prosecution of our language and our cultural identity continue to last.\u201d\n\nView Images Ceferino, a former tobacco smuggler and woodcutter, lives by himself in the mountains of Montenartr\u00f3 near the border of Andorra and France.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer\n\nBayer and Serena set out to capture the essence of rural Catalonian \u201cmicrovillages,\u201d each with less than 500 inhabitants. The book accounts for a third of the Catalan territory, where only 1.4% of the country\u2019s population resides.\n\nMicrocatalonia is a testament to the deep cuts created by the civil war, which are not yet healed. Small villages continue to stand divided from stances taken during the war. For example, one of the oldest cinemas in Spain is located in the small village of Caseres, home to only 250 residents. The cinema, which is owned by a family who fought with the Nationalists, is still not visited by many families who stood with the Republicans.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nCatalonia\u2019s outspoken leader, Carles Puigdemont, continues to push for independence for the region. He has now called for mediation, which the Spanish government says is unacceptable. A Madrid source said to the BBC, \u201cmediation about what?\u201d\n\nPuigdemont has said that Catalonia will declare its independence from Spain within days, specifically, \u201c48 hours after all the official results are counted.\u201d\n\nWorrall notes that this will be a mostly symbolic act, but that the immediate repercussions for Spain are potentially drastic. Prime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status. Catalonia would then be governed by direct rule, which could possibly result in a deployment of troops to the region and the detainment of local politicians.\n\nThe fallout could spread throughout Europe, as other regional separatist movements may find reignited desires for independence, such as Scotland and the New Flemish Alliance in Belgium.\n\nView Images Many families had to abandon their horses over the last decade due to Spain's economic crisis.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer\n\nView Images The Sau Reservoir, which used to cover the former town of Sant Rom\u00e0 de Sau, was created in 1962 after a dam was built near the Ter River.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer", "summary": "Photograph by Edu Bayer\u201cDuring the civil war Catalonia was the Republican fortress and stronghold, and it was from there that the battle against Fascism was launched,\u201d says Worrall.\n\u201cDuring the civil war, the use of our native language was repressed.\nPhotograph by Edu BayerBayer and Serena set out to capture the essence of rural Catalonian \u201cmicrovillages,\u201d each with less than 500 inhabitants.\nMicrocatalonia is a testament to the deep cuts created by the civil war, which are not yet healed.\nPrime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status.", "score": 0}, {"source": "science", "title": "Nearly 900 People Have Won Nobel Prizes.

About a hundred years ago, there were only about a thousand physicists. Now, there are hundreds of thousands\u2014perhaps even a million\u2014worldwide, making the \u201cbreakthrough backlog\u201d that much larger with each passing year.\n\nThat said, novelists and economists have also grown in ranks, yet they aren't graying at the same rate as the sciences. In addition, the overall trend for the Nobel Peace Prize favors younger laureates. The Peace Prize claims the youngest-ever Nobel recipient: education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she co-won the prize in 2014.\n\nNobel laureates are overwhelmingly male.\n\nOut of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. In some disciplines, the drought has persisted for decades: The last woman to win a Nobel Prize for physics, Maria Goeppert Mayer, was honored in 1964. The gap reflects longtime institutional biases against women within the sciences, a lag exacerbated by the decades-long backlog of Nobel-worthy discoveries.\n\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains. Out of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. Male Organization Female 1901 Marie Curie Physics, 1903 Chemistry, 1911 Curie is the only woman who has been honored twice, for her studies about radiation.

They also say that the committee slightly bent prize rules to ensure that Marie Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics. But that may come as small consolation for the supremely qualified female scientists who were never recognized.\n\nFor instance, Lise Meitner, one of the co-discoverers of nuclear fission, was nominated for the physics prize 29 times from 1937 to 1965 and the chemistry prize an additional 19 times from 1924 to 1948, according to Nobel Foundation archival records. She never won. And while astronomer Vera Rubin's groundbreaking work revealing the existence of dark matter received wide acclaim, she died on December 25, 2016, with no Nobel to call her own.

According to the official rules, Nobel Prizes can't be awarded after death.\n\nPhotograph by Corbis, Getty\n\nIncreasingly, Nobel laureates represent much larger scientific collaborations.\n\nNobel Foundation rules say that a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to up to three individuals, reflective of the small-team science that prevailed in the early 20th century. But today, major breakthroughs increasingly come from massive scientific collaborations, and the Nobel Committee has been reticent to award science prizes to broader groups.\n\nThe contrast is especially stark in physics, where scientific collaborations can include thousands of researchers\u2014as illustrated by the breakthrough that earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. The prize went to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish for detecting gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nWhile the trio's contributions were huge, they themselves argue that the prize should have recognized the broader LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which includes hundreds of scientists. After all, the study that announced the detection of gravitational waves has 1,011 co-authors, by Popular Science's count. Just 0.3 percent of them were honored by name in Stockholm.\n\n\"We live in an era where some huge discoveries are really the result of giant collaborations, with major contributions coming from very large numbers of people,\" Thorne says in an interview posted on the Nobel Prize's website.", "summary": "Out of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates Organization While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.", "score": 0}, {"source": "general", "title": "Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister to center of power", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-kim/kim-jong-un-praises-nuclear-program-promotes-sister-to-center-of-power-idUSKBN1CD03V", "top_image_url": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171008&t=2&i=1204611272&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED9704K", "description": "North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a \"powerful deterrent\" that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said \"only one thing will work\" in dealing with the isolated country.", "authors": "James Pearson", "category": "general", "date": "4 hours ago", "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks during the Second Plenum of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang October 8, 2017.

From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.\n\n\u201cHe went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that\u2019s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the younger Mr. Paddock said. \u201cHe went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn\u2019t there either. He went to real estate and that\u2019s where the money was.\u201d\n\nStephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, \u201cwe had cash flow,\u201d said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,\u201d he said.\n\nWith success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.\n\n\u201cHe acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,\u201d said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.\n\nMr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and \u201cuppity about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cHe seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot\u2019s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.\n\n\u201cThis guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,\u201d said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.\n\nEven in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.\n\n\u201cIf Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cHe did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Most Boring\u2019 Son\n\nMr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.\n\n\u201cMy brother was the most boring one in the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said. \u201cHe was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it\u2019s like, who?\u201d\n\nTheir father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a \u201cglib, smooth talking \u2018confidence man,\u2019 who is egotistic and arrogant.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who \u201chas been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.\n\nThe boys\u2019 mother raised them alone on a secretary\u2019s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.\n\n\u201cShe kept that secret from the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said.\n\nStephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.\n\nMr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence. He didn\u2019t always stay between the lines.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.\n\n\u201cEverybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,\u201d Mr. Alarcon said. \u201cHe had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn\u2019t care what it took.\u201d\n\nA Knack for Making Money\n\nMr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not \u201cTaj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCrucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.\n\nHe was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants\u2019 complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.\n\nMr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. \u201cWhat you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.\n\n\u201cHe was frustrated by people who did stupid things,\u201d Mr. Franks said.\n\nHe was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.\n\nThough Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\n\n\u201cHe was a tough negotiator,\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cHe wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.\u201d\n\nThe House Advantage\n\nBy the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock\u2019s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe likes it when people go, \u2018Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?\u201d Eric Paddock said.\n\nGambling made him feel important, if not social.\n\n\u201cYou could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. \u201cHe liked everyone doting on him.\u201d\n\nHe sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.\n\nA couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock\u2019s gambling history.\n\nThe analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.\n\nPlaying a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.\n\nOne of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of \u201cGambling Wizards: Conversations With the World\u2019s Greatest Gamblers.\u201d A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often \u201clock\u201d a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.\n\nFor one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, \u201cbut he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Paddock \u201cknew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.\n\nHe was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Absent Neighbor\n\nMr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.\n\nColleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock\u2019s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.\n\nHe did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.\n\nWhen he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking. \u201cHe said nothing,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cNot a word. No eye contact.\u201d\n\nEven more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone has a reaction to Trump,\u201d said Mr. McKay\u2019s wife, Darlene.\n\nMs. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: \u201cHe always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock\u2019s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.\n\nIt is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.\n\nMr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.\n\nHis neighbors added personal touches to their yards \u2014 decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock\u2019s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.\n\nMs. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.\n\nSeveral days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.\n\nMs. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.", "summary": "Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways.\nMr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence.\nThough Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\nMr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking.\nThe message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.", "score": 0}, {"source": "New York Times", "title": "As Overdose Deaths Pile Up, a Medical Examiner Quits the Morgue", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/drug-overdose-medical-examiner.html", "top_image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/26/us/00medicalexaminer1/00medicalexaminer1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "description": "\u201cIt has completely overwhelmed us,\u201d Dr. Thomas A.

Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O\u2019Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.\n\nIn a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I\u2019m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to \u201cdeal with this issue head on.\u201d\n\nI am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10. \u0097 From Lauren O\u2019Connor\u2018s memo\n\nLisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that \u201che denies many of the accusations as patently false.\u201d In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo were \u201coff base\u201d and that they had parted on good terms.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, \u201cmy motto is to keep the peace.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d She said she had \u201cexplained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Ms. O\u2019Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women\u2019s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with \u201cvulnerable women who hope he will get them work.\u201d\n\nThe allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d to the television show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.\n\nIn 2015, the year Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem\u2019s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women\u2019s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, it seemed golden \u2014 the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,\u201d said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. \u201cBut behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s treatment of women.\n\nDozens of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.\n\nMr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its \u201cbusiness reputation\u201d or \u201cany employee\u2019s personal reputation,\u201d a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.\n\nCharles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not evidence of anything.\u201d\n\nI am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished. \u0097 From Lauren O\u2019Connor\u2018s memo\n\nAt Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the wake of Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein\u2019s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O\u2019Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.\n\n\u201cThe parties made peace very quickly,\u201d Ms. Bloom said.\n\nThrough her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O\u2019Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. \u201cI am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cBut remaining silent is causing me great distress.\u201d\n\nIn speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, \u201cWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it\u2019s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\u201d\n\nA Common Narrative\n\nMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein\u2019s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.\n\n\u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,\u201d one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. \u201cShe was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or skill set.\u201d The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management\u2019s attention through other employees.\n\nAcross the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPhoto\n\nWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing \u201cturndown duty\u201d late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.\n\nIn interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly \u2014 meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. \u201cIt was so manipulative,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou constantly question yourself \u2014 am I the one who is the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.\n\nMost women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.\n\nMs. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. \u201cWe were so young at the time,\u201d said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOthers in the London office said the same. \u201cI was pretty disturbed and angry,\u201d said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the way things were.\u201d\n\nThe human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. \u201cIf a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up\u201d so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.\n\nMany women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.\n\nBut in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern \u2014 young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels \u2014 have accumulated for almost three decades?\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret to the inner circle,\u201d said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein\u2019s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.\n\nSpeaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O\u2019Connor would be better off marrying a \u201cfat, rich Jewish\u201d man because she was probably just good for \u201cbeing a wife\u201d and \u201cmaking babies,\u201d she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.\n\nSteve Hutensky, one of Miramax\u2019s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.\n\nMs. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.\n\nMonths after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.\n\n\u2018Coercive Bargaining\u2019\n\nFor actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and popular attractions like the \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in \u201cChicago\u201d to Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cSilver Linings Playbook.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.\n\nMr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\u201d Ms. Judd said. \u201cIt was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.\u201d\n\nTo get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling \u201cpanicky, trapped,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.\u201d\n\nNot long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with \u201cVariety\u201d without naming the man involved.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was \u201cnot to be construed as an admission\u201d by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to \u201cavoid litigation and buy peace,\u201d according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film \u201cScream\u201d and would later star in the television show \u201cCharmed.\u201d She declined to comment.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nIncreased Scrutiny\n\nJust months before Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.\n\nSoon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.\n\nIn March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.\n\nThe claims were taken up by the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office later declined to bring charges.\n\nBut Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.\n\nMs. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.\n\nThen Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, \u201cThe balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.\u201d\n\nShe was a valued employee \u2014 Mr. Weinstein described her as \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201ca great person,\u201d \u201ca brilliant executive\u201d \u2014 so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O\u2019Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.\n\n\u201cBecause this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo.

Some areas were expected to receive 4 to 6 inches of rainfall as the storm passed through, although forecasters said that a \u201clife threatening\u201d storm surge \u2014 an abnormal rise in water levels of up to several feet \u2014 and wind were likely to cause the biggest problems.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Saturday afternoon that Nate was moving at \u201can extremely fast rate\u201d of 26 miles an hour, which he said was \u201calmost unheard-of for a storm of this type.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven though its speed would limit the amount of time it could deluge any single place, Mr. Edwards said, \u201cthis is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt has proven to be very deadly in Honduras and Nicaragua and that area,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cWe have to make sure we are not taking it lightly.\u201d At least 22 storm-related deaths have been reported in Central America.\n\nAt the 17th Street Canal between New Orleans and Metairie, La., workers from the Army Corps of Engineers lowered a set of enormous gates at the mouth of the canal. On Friday, divers checked the beds that the gates rest on to make sure that they would be able to close.\n\nIn 2005, there were no gates there or at the three other major canals in New Orleans. Katrina\u2019s surge pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain into the canals. When levees along those canals breached, much of the city was inundated, and stayed underwater for weeks, until the breaches could be closed and the neighborhoods pumped dry.

Until then, a structure of gates and temporary pumps has been built to protect nearby neighborhoods.\n\nMayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at a news conference Saturday that he expected the city\u2019s pump system to function effectively. Of the 120 pumps, 108 were working. \u201cWe have plenty enough to deal with the potential rain,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything that we can see, we think we can handle.\u201d\n\nThe city could be without power for as long as a week, officials said. As for the question of how protective the city\u2019s $14.6 billion system of levees, flood walls and gates would be against Nate, Mr. Landrieu expressed cautious optimism. \u201cThere is limited or no risk for storm surge in the city of New Orleans,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the afternoon, as Nate\u2019s outer bands hit New Orleans, rain pounded the streets, pushed by heavy gusts. Pedestrians took off running or huddled under overhangs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNia Johnson, 23, who lives on Alvar Street a few dozen blocks from the Mississippi River, said she and her family had planned to pile into the car and drive to Lafayette, La., because the streets of her area \u201calways flood.\u201d The power would almost certainly go out because of the high winds, she said, leaving them unable to cook for days.\n\nMany of the larger chain establishments in the French Quarter had closed.

Around the corner, a wedding party was out on a second-floor balcony despite the splitting rain.\n\nThe storm nevertheless ground other parts of the central Gulf Coast to a halt. The popular resort town of Orange Beach, Ala., was empty except for ominous red flags whipping in the breeze; the casino city of Biloxi had mostly emptied of the thousands of visitors who had come to the area for Cruisin\u2019 the Coast, a showcase of 8,200 classic cars. On top of that, the Mississippi Gaming Commission closed the casinos here, leaving the waterfront Beau Rivage and other casinos eerily dark.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s just like a ghost town,\u201d said Faith Phillips, 30, a dialysis patient care technician who was waiting for dinner at Waffle House, looking at the Beau Rivage as water encroached on parking lots nearby. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe that all of this was full.\u201d\n\nJust a few hours earlier, there had been an air of calm along the coast.\n\nMerlin and Suzie DeCorte of Metairie, La., stopped at the R & O restaurant with their son Jacob, 8, near the 17th Street Canal in New Orleans, all wearing Louisiana State University T-shirts.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like it was going to be that bad,\u201d Ms. DeCorte said of the storm.

But somehow that did not work out.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\u201cTelevision does not know how to talk about domestic issues.\u2026 Things discussed on television and the kinds of subjects that grip audiences online often have nothing in common. The Kremlin is thinking of bringing these two realities closer together,\u201d the RBC Daily said, quoting an unnamed Kremlin source last April.\n\nIt is amazing how political managers who themselves were responsible for the state-run television forgetting how to cover domestic news talked about it as if it were some natural occurrence. And they did suddenly remember how to do it: the media agenda did change during the summer, but the experiment did not last.\n\nRussian television \u201clives\u201d abroad. Most of the stories these days are again international, some of them indisputably top news, some less obviously so.\n\nThe mass shooting in Las Vegas, the referendum in Catalonia that was marred by clashes with the Spanish police, and Monarch Airlines going into administration in the UK were the top items on Russia\u2019s Channel One in the early evening this Monday.\n\nUnderstanding the latter two stories would help cast light on the reasons why Russian state-run media devote so much time and effort to foreign coverage.\n\nWhy the Monarch Airlines story has been featured prominently on Russian television is easy to explain. Russia had just recently suffered the collapse of a private airline, VIM Avia, that left up to 80,000 tourists stranded at various destinations throughout the world.\n\nMIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/AFP/Getty\n\nThe airline\u2019s predicament is not an isolated event. To report about it responsibly would mean putting it in the context of other bankruptcies, which have become increasingly common recently.\n\nTwo major banks, Otkritie and B&N Bank, just went under in September; VIM Avia and Hospitality Planet, a fast food chain, are now joining them. Private banks, manufacturing companies, retail outlets, hotels, and restaurant chains in Russia are going out of business at a frightening pace.\n\nBankruptcies may be a sign of growing pains, of creative destruction, as it were, but it does not look like it this time. \u201cDuring previous crises, new firms used to be created to replace those closing down; not so this time,\u201d the economist Georgy Ostapkovich told Vedomosti daily recently. \u201cIt\u2019s happening across all sectors. More firms are going than are coming to replace them, with a ratio of 35 percent. And it is not a lack of funding that most entrepreneurs are citing. The general feeling of uncertainty is to blame, half of them say. They don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on in the Russian economy.\u201d\n\nReporting all these stories in context would call for a serious conversation about the state of Russia\u2019s economy, the impact of the West\u2019s sanctions, and the efficacy of Moscow\u2019s economic policies. But comparing the collapse of a Russian airline to the collapse of Monarch Airlines, a British firm, is an altogether different story.\n\nIt tells us that running a business is risky and bad things may happen everywhere, even in Britain, the quintessential capitalist country. Thus, telling the sorry tale of Monarch Airlines, a company most Russians have never heard of, serves the purpose of saying that everywhere is just like Russia.\n\nThe story of the Catalan referendum is even more fundamental in sending a similar message. Discussing domestic regional separatism in Russia may be considered a crime, but any international story involving a regional population\u2019s struggle for independence from an oppressive or not so oppressive national capital is fair game for Russia\u2019s state-run television.\n\nThe Scottish referendum of 2014 was all over the Russian news. It was the year when Moscow went into Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The legitimacy of the annexation was based on a referendum hastily organized and conducted under the watch of the \u201clittle green men,\u201d the Russian troops wearing no insignia, already present on the peninsula.\n\nIt is likely that in the event of a properly organized plebiscite, the Crimeans would have supported a course for independence or even agreed to join the Russian Federation. Or not. We will never know now.\n\nThe lack of time for proper campaigning (effectively less than two weeks), the organization of a referendum with the troops present, the voting being boycotted by an important minority, the Crimean Tatars, and a number of other issues do not allow calling the referendum a binding expression of the will of the Crimean people. A UN General Assembly resolution was later adopted that declared the referendum invalid and affirmed Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nThe referendum on Scottish independence, which took place that same year, was a godsend. It allowed Moscow\u2019s media managers to create a context for the Crimean referendum that would not have otherwise existed.\n\nAudiences were invited to delve into Scotland\u2019s complicated relationship with England over the centuries and have an enlightened discussion of nations\u2019 right to self-determination. And, of course, \u201ccitizens\u2019 journalism,\u201d well organized by Russian media managers, worked wonders on social networks.\n\nSince then I have come to realize that romanticized accounts of distant as well as current events can be used to create attractive stories that feed a political agenda to unwitting audiences, while young activists gripped by a historic moment in the life of their country may be paid bloggers taking shifts in a St. Petersburg office.\n\nThe Catalan story only confirms the narrative of separatism being increasingly common in the decadent West. Russian political managers can exploit the theme for ages; they know how to do it well. But it is hard to imagine that this is what they themselves need during the presidential election coming up next spring.\n\nThe incumbent, who is expected to announce his candidacy soon, will have to talk about Russia\u2019s domestic economy, its schools and hospitals. And Russian TV producers well trained to cover Scotland and Catalonia will have to take a crash course in covering their own land.\n\nMaxim Trudolyubov is Senior Fellow with the Kennan Institute and editor-at-large with Vedomosti.", "summary": "Russian television \u201clives\u201d abroad.\nWhy the Monarch Airlines story has been featured prominently on Russian television is easy to explain.\nBut comparing the collapse of a Russian airline to the collapse of Monarch Airlines, a British firm, is an altogether different story.\nAnd, of course, \u201ccitizens\u2019 journalism,\u201d well organized by Russian media managers, worked wonders on social networks.\nThe incumbent, who is expected to announce his candidacy soon, will have to talk about Russia\u2019s domestic economy, its schools and hospitals.", "score": 0}, {"source": "Newsweek", "title": "Under President Trump's new budget, if you don't work, you don't eat: Republicans are kicking people off SNAP", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/under-trumps-new-budget-if-you-dont-work-you-dont-eat-republicans-are-kicking-679749", "top_image_url": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/10/06/gettyimages-484129328.jpg", "description": "The budget will take over $150 billion away from SNAP, a program that helps low-income people keep food on the table.", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/christiannajsilva/", "category": "general", "date": "16 hours ago", "text": "UPDATE: The budget resolution passed by the House on Thursday will push millions of already struggling people off food stamps, leaving the neediest Americans\u2014children and the elderly among them\u2014without food.\n\nThe $4.1-trillion budget will take over $150 billion away from several poverty programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps low-income people keep food on the table, by giving them small amounts of supplemental money to spend on groceries\u2014anywhere from $100 a month to $700 a month for a family of five, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThis budget isn't the newest problem SNAP has had to face. The number of people on SNAP ebbs and flows with the economy, but only 75 percent of people who are eligible for SNAP actually participate in the program, the website Snap to Health says. And it's because applying can get really complicated.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nEvan Teske, a 26-year-old medical student, needed assistance while he was working for Americorps. After graduating from college in 2014, Americorps assigned him to Focuspoint Family Research Center, which focuses on education from childhood to adulthood. His stipend just wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cSo I had to apply for food stamps,\u201d Teske told Newsweek.\n\nThe application process was pretty confusing, he said, but Americorps helped him apply. Then, after about a year and a half, he was taken off.\n\n\u201cI got taken off by the government against my will because every six months I had to update my paperwork so they could see how much they were giving me,\u201d Teske said. \u201cAnd at one point, when food stamps and a stipend still wasn\u2019t quite enough, I had help from my parents and family members to help me out in a pinch. When I put that down in the updated documents, they didn\u2019t call it an income, but they said it was extra. So they cut me off.\u201d\n\nTeske worked for Americorps for the next six months and then moved to New Mexico for medical school. He said SNAP and food stamps made his life more livable.\n\nTeske was taken off food stamps because his family helped him when he was needing a bit more. If Trump's budget proposal passes the Senate, as it has already passed the House, many more people will be bumped off SNAP\u2014and a lot of them won't have the familial safety net that Teske did.\n\n\u201cSNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in the U.S.,\u201d Ellen Vollinger, the legal director who directs SNAP work at the Food Research and Action Center, told Newsweek. \u201cIt\u2019s the one program that\u2019s available all over the country to serve people who need food. It\u2019s the most accessible and available to people.\u201d\n\nBut lately, for two big reasons, fewer people have been taking advantage of SNAP. First of all, the economy is doing better, which means fewer people are struggling with poverty and fewer people need the program.\n\nIn 2009, about 32 million people received SNAP benefits. The number increased during the great recession to an annual high of 47.6 million in 2013. Then, as the economy began to improve, it was down to 43 million in April 2010. And it's continue to show. From April 2015 to April 2016, it was all the way down by 1.9 million participants.\n\n\u201cThe unemployment rate has often been a pretty good indicator for the need for SNAP. As it comes down, there might be a bit of a lag, but we see SNAP come down,\u201d Vollinger said.\n\nThe second reason, however, is that some states are cutting corners by making it more difficult to apply for SNAP so they make more room in their budget.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that they\u2019re eligible,\u201d Ginger Zielinskie, president and CEO of Benefits Data Trust, a company that connects people with the services they need, told Newsweek. \u201cThe first barrier is awareness. ... It can be a really complicated application process.\u201d\n\nMoreover, some state laws don\u2019t allow people to stay on SNAP for longer than a few months unless they have jobs, are training for jobs or are doing community service. But in times of economic stress, there aren\u2019t always jobs available for them.\n\nTake, for example, Devon Bracher, who graduated from Vanderbilt with an engineering degree and was living with her two sisters in Portland, Oregon, when she applied to get on SNAP after not being able to find a job.\n\n\u201cTechnically, my residency was in Virginia, but all my work experience was in Tennessee,\u201d Bracher told Newsweek. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a job, I was looking for jobs. This was my first year after graduating. That was part of what's complicated. I wasn\u2019t an Oregon resident, but I didn\u2019t have an official job in Virginia. Virginia told me to apply to Tennessee.\u201d\n\nSo Bracher went through the online application for SNAP. But the system had her call a SNAP representative because she wasn\u2019t a Tennessee resident.\n\n\u201cI probably called maybe like five different times and the line was always busy,\u201d Bracher said. Eventually, she just gave up.\n\n\u201cI benefitted a lot from being able to live with family,\u201d Bracher said. \u201cMy sisters helped a lot.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has a family like Bracher\u2019s, and if the proposed cuts to SNAP make its way through, the states will be responsible to keep families from starving.\n\nIn Alabama, for instance, the number of able-bodied people on SNAP has dropped from around 5,000 to 800. Most of it is because of the regulations states are forced to place on the benefits so that they can make their budget, a trend that's seen all over the U.S.\n\nCalifornians have concerns people who need programs like SNAP won't be able to access them under Trump's new budget, according to Jared Call from California Food Policy Advocates.\n\n\u201cWe try to think of people first, but this particular [budget proposal] \u2026 would really seek to shift a substantial share to the states or propose penalties to put states on the hook and that\u2019s just not something that state budgets are prepared to absorb,\u201d he told Newsweek.\n\n\u201cCalifornia would go down $1.8 billion to just keep even. So you\u2019re faced with cutting other important services or education or other programs or cutting benefit amounts or cutting eligibility,\" Call said. \"We want SNAP to go to the people who need it, but this proposal does not work that way. There is no way to cut SNAP without impacting benefit levels or eligibility. Ninety-four percent of these funds go directly to benefits, there\u2019s no fat to cut.\u201d\n\nOne in six people in America faces hunger, more than almost any other country in the developed world. If this budget goes through, and important programs like SNAP are axed, that number will be on the rise.\n\nStory was updated to clarify the number of SNAP participants between 2015 and 2016 and the number of able-bodied people on SNAP in Alabama.", "summary": "UPDATE: The budget resolution passed by the House on Thursday will push millions of already struggling people off food stamps, leaving the neediest Americans\u2014children and the elderly among them\u2014without food.\n\u201cSo I had to apply for food stamps,\u201d Teske told Newsweek.\nTeske was taken off food stamps because his family helped him when he was needing a bit more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one program that\u2019s available all over the country to serve people who need food.\n\u201cTechnically, my residency was in Virginia, but all my work experience was in Tennessee,\u201d Bracher told Newsweek.", "score": 0}, {"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "PSA: Don\u2019t share your old AIM screen\u00a0name", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/06/dont-share-aol-instant-messenger-aim-login/", "top_image_url": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/3865744952_8e004650ac_o-e1507332811901.jpg", "description": "Hello it's the fun police!

(0:46)\n\nWeek 6 wasn't expected to have many surprises, so we were as blindsided as Michigan and Oklahoma by what transpired. Saturday was the third day in the past 10 seasons that at least two AP top-10 teams lost at home to unranked opponents, as the seventh-ranked Wolverines and third-ranked Sooners each lost as home favorites.\n\nIt wasn't just about championship contenders having a bad loss delivered to their doorsteps. No lead -- not even an extra point -- was safe. We needed two overtimes in Austin and seven in Buffalo. Oklahoma was favored by 30.5 points over Iowa State and led 24-10 ... and lost.\n\nEven Alabama committed its first turnover and had a punt blocked. (Afterward, Nick Saban likened positive media coverage for his team to \"rat poison.\")\n\nSaturday didn't teach us a ton about where a lot of teams stand, but we did have a great time watching all the drama unfold.

We've let teams come back in games and give them hope. When you do that to a team who has their back against the wall, it's something you can't do. When you have a chance to bury a team, you have to take care of it. The great teams take care of that business ... you have to do your job every play.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, No. 8 TCU is the leader of the pack in the Big 12. The eighth-ranked Horned Frogs have already beaten Oklahoma State but proved they were for real on Saturday by surviving No. 23 West Virginia in a back-and-forth, 31-24 win.\n\nThe Thrill is certainly back with quarterback Kenny Hill, as the former Texas A&M enigma has totally reinvented himself in Fort Worth.

No. 21 Florida found out the hard way, as Eddy Pineiro's missed extra point was the difference in the Gators' 17-16 loss to a woeful LSU team. Florida was full of mistakes -- powered mostly by a sterile playbook -- but the Gators were upended by a special-teams mistake in a game they should have won.\n\nA fraction of an inch was also the difference in Miami's last-second win over Florida State in Tallahassee after a magical fourth quarter. Miami quarterback Malik Rosier delivered the final blow with a perfectly thrown, 23-yard touchdown pass to Darrell Langham, who fell into the end zone with six seconds left, his knee just going down after the ball crossed the goal line. The Canes ended a seven-game losing streak to the Noles and jumped right into the thick of the ACC -- and, yes -- playoff race.\n\nTwo teams miles away from playoff talk are Western Michigan and Buffalo, but they were the darlings of the day with their seven overtimes and record-breaking 139 points. Western Michigan finally put Buffalo away 71-68 on a 12-yard run by Jarvion Franklin, but it was actually the Broncos' first overtime touchdown that stole the show. After quarterback Jon Wassink hit Donnie Ernsberger for a 14-yard touchdown to tie the game at 38, Ernsberger's sister ran onto the field and celebrated with her brother in the end zone before being escorted off.\n\nThere wasn't a rogue family member rushing the field in Austin, but it was certainly a Texas-sized family affair for the Longhorns with their 40-34, double-overtime win over Kansas State featuring their own \"Bush Push\" winner starring Chris Warren III and ever-improving starting quarterback Sam Ehlinger.\n\nSaturday proved we don't always need compelling playoff storylines to have fun in this sport.

(1:27)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. -- When the skies opened up, Michigan took to the air. It cost the Wolverines another loss to in-state rival Michigan State and perhaps a shot at oh, so much more.\n\nDuring a stretch of three drives that spanned the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, while sheets of rain soaked the Big House, the Wolverines' offensive staff dialed up 11 passes on 14 plays for a second-string quarterback making his second start in Ann Arbor. John O'Korn completed one of them for a first down. Three of them were intercepted. And with that, the Spartans had the space to hold on and upset No. 7 Michigan 14-10, Michigan State's eighth win over Michigan in a decade.\n\n\"Yeah, you can criticize that,\" Harbaugh said of the passes. \"We were trying to run the ball. We were trying to put drives together. We really were.\"\n\nMark Dantonio continues to pull rabbits out of his hat in East Lansing. His Spartans are now an improbable 4-1 -- the same as the Wolverines -- and have seemingly put the on-field disaster of the 2016 season behind them. Dantonio said earlier this week that his goal when he took over at Michigan State was to make this game into a rivalry again. \"I think it's a rivalry. We'll leave it at that,\" he said, and then proceeded to knock off an undefeated Michigan team on the road for the second time in the last three years.\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan's chosen son, Jim Harbaugh, has lost four games in his five tries against his alma mater's biggest rivals.\n\nMichigan State players celebrated a win over Michigan while holding the spoils of that victory, the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Leon Halip/Getty Images\n\nMichigan State's offense didn't pick up a first down for the first 27 minutes of the second half. It didn't really need one. Brian Lewerke threw for one touchdown and ran for another in the first two quarters of a game that was heated, physical and full of mistakes on both sides.\n\nThe Wolverines' sins, five turnovers, turned out to be more mortal. Senior running back Ty Isaac fumbled near midfield in the first quarter. Michigan State converted the good field position into its first points of the game. Lewerke showed his athleticism and guts on the touchdown play, diving into a crowd of Michigan defenders at the goal line.\n\nHe later orchestrated a nine-play march that ended with a well-designed screen play to running back Madre London for the Spartans' second score of the game. London later broke a 50-yard run that put Michigan State in position to push the Wolverines from their heels to their backsides before halftime. His run would prove to be the Spartans' last first down before their final drive of the game. Michigan's defense held Lewerke & Co. to 66 total yards in the second half but couldn't carry quite enough water to salvage a victory.\n\nThe defense did provide Michigan's biggest second-half spark. After a botched punt return attempt -- of all things in this series -- the Wolverines' defense narrowly missed picking up a safety on back-to-back plays. It did force Jake Hartbarger to punt with his earhole in the Michigan student section. O'Korn & Co. converted good field position into a quick score, their only touchdown of the game.\n\nO\u2019Korn finished the game 16-of-35 passing for 198 yards and three interceptions. His two starts since transferring to Michigan in 2015 have come during a snow-blanketed game last November and a rain-soaked one this weekend. He showed the ability to escape a pass rush and create momentum at times against the Spartans, but also appeared to lose his poise during that turnover deluge early in the final quarter.\n\nIt appears that if Michigan is going to resurrect its hopes to bring some type of a championship to Ann Arbor in Harbaugh's third year, O'Korn will be the quarterback to guide the Wolverines through at least the majority of that stretch. Michigan's defense will need to provide plenty of help, and it can. The quarterback also will need some help from the men calling his plays.", "summary": "It cost the Wolverines another loss to in-state rival Michigan State and perhaps a shot at oh, so much more.\n7 Michigan 14-10, Michigan State's eighth win over Michigan in a decade.\nMichigan State players celebrated a win over Michigan while holding the spoils of that victory, the Paul Bunyan Trophy.\nLondon later broke a 50-yard run that put Michigan State in position to push the Wolverines from their heels to their backsides before halftime.\nAfter a botched punt return attempt -- of all things in this series -- the Wolverines' defense narrowly missed picking up a safety on back-to-back plays.", "score": 0}, {"source": "ESPN", "title": "Week 5 NFL predictions: Scores for every game", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/251447/week-5-nfl-predictions-scores-for-every-game", "top_image_url": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1006%2Fr140692_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "description": "NFL Nation reporters give their picks for Week 5, including whether the Cowboys can bounce back against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.", "authors": null, "category": "sport", "date": "6 hours ago", "text": "NFL Nation reporters predict the outcomes and scores for Sunday's and Monday's Week 5 games.\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Bills might be 3-1 and playing the 1-3 Bengals, but Vegas seems to like Cincinnati in this game. Buffalo is at least a three-point underdog on the road, suggesting this could be a trap game for the Bills after big wins over Denver and Atlanta. The Bills' offense -- which has gone three-and-out on 48 percent of drives this season, second most in the NFL -- will be playing short-handed at wide receiver because of a thumb injury to No. 1 wideout Jordan Matthews. Tyrod Taylor has excelled in passing to Charles Clay and LeSean McCoy this season, but the Bengals boast the NFL's lowest yards per catch (6.49) by opposing tight ends and running backs. Bengals 13, Bills 9 -- Mike Rodak\n\nThe Bengals have a tough matchup against one of the league's best defenses (Buffalo is 10th overall), but it looks like their offense finally has begun to click in the past two weeks. The Bengals can build on their momentum here, and a win would make them 2-3 prior to their bye. Bengals 14, Bills 10 -- Katherine Terrell\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nCoach Todd Bowles says \"2-2 is nothing to brag about.\" In most cases, he'd be right, but there has been a sense of satisfaction this week in the Jets' locker room -- a possible red flag. It wouldn't be a shock if they underestimate the Browns, but they have too many matchups in their favor to lose the game. Josh McCown has completed 75 percent of his passes against the blitz, which bodes well against the blitz-heavy Browns, who have allowed a 127 passer rating when blitzing. It sounds crazy, but the Jets will win their third straight game. Jets 20, Browns 17 -- Rich Cimini\n\nOld friend Josh McCown is healthy and completing 70 percent of his passes, and the Jets have won two in a row with the kind of run-pass balance that the Browns should study. At 0-4, the Browns talked a good game all week, but there was a feeling that folks were looking over their shoulder. That's not the attitude a winless team needs. Jets 24, Browns 10 -- Pat McManamon\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Lions are strong against the run, which makes the timing of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton finding his timing against New England most important. But the key in this one will be the ability of the Carolina defense to make the Lions one-dimensional and force Matthew Stafford to beat them. Stafford already has been sacked 12 times, and the Panthers, with future Hall of Famer Julius Peppers playing at a high level (4.5 sacks), have the firepower to get Stafford off his game. Panthers 24, Lions 21 -- David Newton\n\nDefending Newton will be tough, and linebacker Luke Kuechly could cause Stafford some issues, but the Lions have shown they are one of the better teams in the NFC. They also have a good secondary, which already has five interceptions. These teams are evenly matched, so quarterback play could make the difference. In that case, at home, Stafford has the edge. The Lions' defense gets another interception and Stafford throws for three touchdowns. Lions 28, Panthers 20 -- Michael Rothstein\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThis is the second of three consecutive road games for the Niners, and they're coming off a trio of games they lost by a combined eight points. Given the Colts' struggles protecting the quarterback (they've allowed 14 sacks, tied for fifth most in the league) and the Niners' ability to take advantage of porous offensive lines (nine sacks total against Seattle and Arizona), this would seem to be the type of game the 49ers can win. However, Indianapolis figures to be rocking as Peyton Manning is honored with a statue, and mobile signal-callers like Jacoby Brissett have helped mitigate some of San Francisco's pass-rush ability. This feels like it could go either way, but the edge goes to the home team. Colts 23, 49ers 20 -- Nick Wagoner\n\nThe last thing the Colts can do is overlook the 49ers. The Colts' three losses have come to the same three teams that San Francisco has lost to -- Arizona, Los Angeles Rams and Seattle -- and Indianapolis lost those games by a combined 68 points. The Colts, like in previous seasons, are struggling statistically on defense, ranking 31st overall. Things are lined up -- on paper at least -- for the 49ers to get their first victory of the season. But this will be an emotional weekend at Lucas Oil Stadium for the Colts. Peyton Manning is getting his own statue in front of the stadium and will have his jersey retired Sunday. Chuck Pagano has never started a season 1-4 as coach of the Colts. They'll do just enough to keep things that way. Colts 21, 49ers 17 -- Mike Wells\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nMarcus Mariota's playing status could be unknown until Sunday, but the Titans have problems to solve even if he does find a way to play. The Titans' pass defense was a disaster as the Titans gave up 57 points to the Texans in a Week 4 rout. And the Dolphins' struggling offense presents three receivers who could give them fits once again. These two teams played last year in similar circumstances, with the Titans leaving with the victory due to Mariota's four touchdowns and a stout running game. They'll have to do it Sunday with a lot of attention on the running game, whether Mariota or Matt Cassel is under center. Dolphins 19, Titans 17 -- Cameron Wolfe\n\nThe Dolphins allowed 235 rushing yards in last year's loss to the Titans. However, Miami is vastly improved in that area, allowing just 3.1 yards per rush and 78 yards per game this season. If the Titans can't run, they are in trouble against the Dolphins, especially with the uncertainty of Mariota (hamstring). Dolphins 17, Titans 14 -- James Walker\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Chargers finished 1-3 on trips to the East Coast last season and are in the midst of a nine-game losing streak. So this is a game the Chargers normally would lose, which is why I\u2019m picking them to win -- along with the fact that I believe the Giants will have trouble stopping the Bolts\u2019 talented pass-rushing duo of Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa. Through the first four games, the Giants have played three starting offensive line combinations up front. Chargers 20, Giants 19 -- Eric Williams\n\nThe Giants are at home in a game they badly need to keep from imploding. It helps the Chargers are also winless (0-4) and can't run the ball (28th in NFL). The Giants have had trouble stopping the run, and it could be a problem again this week with Olivier Vernon and Jason Pierre-Paul struggling with injuries. But the Chargers are the right opponent at the right time. Eli Manning beats Philip Rivers for the first time in his career. Giants 24, Chargers 23 -- Jordan Raanan\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Cardinals are 0-2 this season against NFC teams not in their division, but the biggest question mark will be whether the Cardinals can keep Carson Palmer on his feet. Arizona has given up 17 sacks while the Eagles have 10 on the season, but Palmer called the Eagles' front seven one of the best he will face this year. However, Arizona's primary hope for winning this game lies with its run defense. It's ranked fourth in rushing yards allowed per play (3.2), while the Eagles are ranked fifth in rushing yards gained per play (4.7). Eagles 27, Cardinals 17 -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nLarry Fitzgerald long has tortured the Eagles, averaging six catches, 99 yards and more than a touchdown per game against them in seven meetings. Paired with fellow receivers John Brown and Jaron Brown, the Arizona wideouts pose a threat to a vulnerable Eagles cornerback group. With DT Fletcher Cox still working through a calf injury, there's a chance Palmer will have a little more time to operate. If that's the case, the Cardinals could pull off the upset. Cardinals 30, Eagles 27 -- Tim McManus\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nIt's hard to know what the Jaguars are going to get from QB Blake Bortles each week, and this week may be even more of a mystery because the Jaguars may be without WR Marqise Lee because of a rib injury. That would mean bigger roles for undrafted rookie Keelan Cole (four catches) and recently signed first-year player Max McCaffrey. That will make it even harder for the Jaguars to do much in the passing game, especially downfield, to open things up for RB Leonard Fournette. Plus, the Jaguars gave up 256 yards rushing last week to the Jets and now face the league's best back in Le'Veon Bell. If the Jaguars have the same kind of issues along the defensive front they did last week, it'll be another long day. Steelers 24, Jaguars 10 -- Mike DiRocco\n\nThe Steelers' offense is poised to break out eventually; Ben Roethlisberger has only one completion of more than 40 yards this season -- which came in Week 2, his only home game. Big Ben's 3-1 home-away touchdown ratio since 2015 looms large here, especially with Bell looking like his 2016 self and Jacksonville entering the week allowing 5.7 yards per carry, the league's worst by a large margin. Plus, Antonio Brown is angry and wants the ball, which means he's due for a big game. Steelers 27, Jaguars 20 -- Jeremy Fowler\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Seahawks are coming off one of the more dominant halves of football they've played under Pete Carroll, outscoring the Colts 36-3 and holding them to 32 yards in the second half last week. That was a reminder that their defense remains one of the NFL's best. The offense remains a question mark, however, and could be without starting left tackle Rees Odhiambo because of a chest injury. Even at full strength, Seattle's offensive line will have its hands full against a Rams front four that has given the Seahawks all sorts of trouble during the past few seasons. Russell Wilson's QBR in five road games against the Rams is 48.6 compared with 71.5 in his 37 other road games. This has the makings of another close loss. Rams 24, Seahawks 23 -- Brady Henderson\n\nThe Rams are feeling really good about themselves, coming off a big road win against the Cowboys. Their offense is clicking on all cylinders, and their defense finally showed signs of life in the second half Sunday, holding Dallas to a mere six points. They'll be energized, while at home against a tough division rival, and will sneak out another close win. Rams 23, Seahawks 20 -- Alden Gonzalez\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Ravens catch a break with EJ Manuel starting at quarterback for the injured Derek Carr. But Joe Flacco's struggles (one touchdown in his past 28 drives) and Baltimore's poor history traveling out west (five consecutive losses) make it difficult to have any confidence in the Ravens. Raiders 20, Ravens 13 -- Jamison Hensley\n\nAs easy as it would be to go with Baltimore -- the Raiders have converted just two of their past 24 third-down opportunities and are without starting QB Derek Carr -- the home crowd is the X factor, and so is the confidence Oakland has in Manuel. The Raiders opened the season with three of their first four games on the road. Expect the Raiders' overachieving defense to make a play or two -- paging Khalil Mack and his four sacks -- to jump-start the offense, and all will be right in Silver and Blackdom ... for a week, at least. Raiders 23, Ravens 16 -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThree key players from the Packers\u2019 playoff victory over the Cowboys are gone -- Jared Cook (the tight end who caught the sideline pass to set up the game-winning field goal), Micah Hyde (the safety who had an interception) and T.J. Lang (the Pro Bowl guard who protected Aaron Rodgers). Sure, the Packers have found replacements for all three, but those were big-time players who performed in the clutch. They might miss them Sunday. Cowboys 27, Packers 23 -- Rob Demovsky\n\nFor the second consecutive week, the Cowboys are facing a team with a 10-day break. The advantage for the Packers does not lie so much in the schematics, but the rest, which allowed four key offensive players more time to get ready. But it\u2019s not like Rodgers needs time to get ready to face a Rod Marinelli-coached defense. Including playoffs, Rodgers has thrown 29 touchdown passes with just eight interceptions in 15 games. Most important, Rodgers is 13-2 in those games, dating back to 2008. Packers 33, Cowboys 27 -- Todd Archer\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Chiefs are 8-1 against quarterbacks in their first season as starters since Andy Reid arrived as head coach and Bob Sutton as defensive coordinator in 2013. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll have an easy time against Houston rookie QB Deshaun Watson. They\u2019ll give up some yards and some plays. But they\u2019ll defeat him as they have other young quarterbacks except for Oakland\u2019s Derek Carr as a rookie in 2014. Chiefs 24, Texans 20 -- Adam Teicher\n\nDeshaun Watson and the Texans' offense made a big statement scoring 57 points against the Titans. But this week, players and coaches have been quick to say that was one game and the Chiefs present a different challenge. Watson will continue to play well, but the Texans\u2019 defense will have a tough time containing the speed Kansas City has on offense. Chiefs 27, Texans 20 -- Sarah Barshop\n\nPickCenter | Tickets\n\nThe Vikings' defense aims to take advantage of Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s inexperience at quarterback by disguising coverages and playing hide-and-seek with its blitzes. There\u2019s not a whole lot of tape out there on Trubisky, which is a disadvantage for Minnesota in game planning. Since Chicago isn\u2019t a huge threat with its receivers, the defense will focus on Tarik Cohen and Jordan Howard in the running game. If Sam Bradford makes it through three days of practice this week and is ready to play, he will start in Chicago. And regardless of who\u2019s at quarterback, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs need to spark the Vikings' aerial attack early while the running game gets in its groove with Latavius Murray taking the reins for an injured Dalvin Cook. Vikings 20, Bears 17 -- Courtney Cronin\n\nThe Bears are 14-2 in their past 16 home games against the Vikings dating back to the 2001 season. But Minnesota\u2019s defense is tough. The Vikings sacked Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford six times in a losing effort last week. Overall, Minnesota is tied for eighth in points allowed (19.0) and third in rushing yards allowed (71.3). There\u2019s a ton of excitement in Chicago about Trubisky -- and rightfully so. But Trubisky is making his first career start on Monday Night Football. No one really knows what to expect. The Vikings are banged up on offense but probably still good enough to squeak out a close victory.

(2:13)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- As Robbie Ray and the Arizona Diamondbacks are finding out, the Los Angeles Dodgers are like a baseball version of the Borg from \"Star Trek.\" We\u2019ll explain that in a bit.\n\nFirst, the meat of the subject is that the Dodgers knocked off the Diamondbacks 8-5 on Saturday to seize a 2-0 lead in their National League Division Series matchup. Austin Barnes and Yasiel Puig each drove in two runs to back the work of seven L.A. pitchers.\n\n\u201cThese games are dogfights,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a team effort and a collective unit. We\u2019ve been doing this kind of all year.\u201d\n\nNow, to explain that analogy for the uninitiated: The Borg are an alien collective with a hive-like consciousness. Their M.O. is to find, conquer and assimilate new civilizations. With each assimilation, subsequent iterations of themselves are improved. If what you do works, they will make it theirs. There is no individuality.\n\nSure, that\u2019s laying it on a bit thick, but these are the things that occur to you when you have watched the Dodgers for the past six months. Resisting the Dodgers is futile. Your successful track record against them is irrelevant. You can come at them with stars, and they will come back at you with a machinelike efficiency that improves with each iteration.\n\n\u201cWe did a good job as a lineup just making [Ray] work,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously the better approach we\u2019ve had against him. We\u2019ve seen him many times, so we knew what we were going to get.\u201d\n\nYasiel Puig was 3-for-4 with two RBIs as the Dodgers took a 2-0 NLDS lead. AP Photo/Jae C. Hong\n\nTo wit: The Dodgers failed to beat Ray in five tries during the regular season. Two of those were no-decisions, but he was 3-0 with a 2.27 ERA and struck out a ridiculous 53 batters in 31\u2154 innings.\n\nThese numbers, we remind you, were put up against a team that won 104 games.\n\nAs it turned out, all of that was merely bytes of data for the Dodgers to sort through -- to assimilate, if you will -- and turn to their advantage. Or, perhaps, Ray simply had a bad night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a pitcher,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a tall task trying to battle him and get baserunners. I think, today, he just wasn\u2019t that sharp. The fastball command wasn\u2019t like it has been against us. I think he couldn\u2019t strike the breaking ball. To our guys\u2019 credit, we got the pitch count up and took advantage of that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of evidence for the latter theory. Ray walked four batters over the first three innings. He threw three wild pitches -- the first postseason pitcher to do that since Milwaukee\u2019s Yovani Gallardo in 2001. He plunked Justin Turner with a pitch that, as it turned out, kick-started a four-run L.A. rally in the fifth that broke the game open.\n\n\u201cWell, they grind out their at-bats,\u201d Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cNo matter who is at the plate. There is a lot of versatility they have.\u201d\n\nStill, this was Dodgers baseball, circa the 21st century. If the pitcher is wild, let him be wild. If the outfielder throws to the wrong base -- as J.D. Martinez did during that fifth inning -- take the free bag. If the baserunners are being ignored, let them steal -- L.A. had four thefts on the night.\n\nThe stars of the Dodgers\u2019 lineup were mostly quiet. None of Corey Seager, Turner or Cody Bellinger had a particularly big night.\n\nInstead, it was an RBI single from Chris Taylor here, a pinch-hit single by Curtis Granderson there, Barnes\u2019 big hit, Puig delighting the crowd with his antics and his production. All of these things strung together to build a 7-2 Dodgers firewall against defeat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of good players and a lot of good depth,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere are so many guys in our lineup that can hurt you. I don\u2019t how many times they were on base, but those 6, 7, 8 spots [in the batting order] were on base all night, being productive, driving runs in.\u201d\n\nAnd there wasn\u2019t a dominant pitching performance, either, to define the evening. Rich Hill gave up Paul Goldschmidt\u2018s two-run homer early, but settled in thereafter. But when the Dodgers loaded the bases in the fifth, he was removed. It was what the collective called for. Tony Cingrani got one out. Kenta Maeda, a starter for most of the season, looked like a bona-fide reliever, striking out two of the three he faced.\n\n\u201cThe big thing for us is the guys that aren\u2019t in there are wanting to prove something, and I think that gives them a little added edge,\u201d second baseman Logan Forsythe said. \u201cThey come out with a chip on their shoulder, and they want to get the job done.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers again ran into trouble in the seventh, as they did Friday when Clayton Kershaw was chased by back-to-back homers. Tony Watson gave up a pair of singles, and Brandon Morrow came on to serve up Brandon Drury's pinch-hit, three-run homer. As it was for a fleeting moment of Game 1, the Diamondbacks had again become a threat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the great characteristics of this team,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cWe\u2019re a smart, tough baseball team, and we feel like we can strike at any time offensively.\u201d\n\nNo worries. The Dodgers loaded the bases against Archie Bradley, and a drone, er, Taylor ripped one through the legs of Diamondbacks shortstop Ketel Marte into left field for an insurance run. Then, to complete the assimilation, closer Kenley Jansen came on to demonstrate the futility of resistance, getting the final five outs of the night.\n\nFor L.A., this setup-relief issue is the most worrisome trait of an otherwise unassailable Dodgers roster. It was telling that last season\u2019s setup ace, Pedro Baez, who has struggled lately, didn\u2019t contribute. For the Diamondback to exploit that flaw, they\u2019ll need to assimilate a few lessons of their own.\n\nNow the Diamondbacks are in survival mode. The series shifts back to Phoenix for Monday\u2019s Game 3, and Arizona will turn to their ace, former Dodger Zack Greinke, to save their season. Greinke is certainly capable of doing that. But the Dodgers know Greinke well, and we know what the Dodgers do with knowledge.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got to pick one guy to stop this situation that we\u2019re in,\u201d Lovullo said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve found the right guy in Zack Greinke.\u201d\n\nReminders that the Dodgers are a great, ancient civilization were all over the place before the game. Tommy Lasorda was recognized during a video celebration. Maury Wills threw out the first pitch. Sandy Koufax was hanging around, still looking so fit from a distance that you could almost see him getting a batter or two.\n\nBut those great individuals helped establish the Dodgers brand, and now that brand trumps everything. The Dodgers have stars, but the stars are parts of a whole that have grown into something great. The Diamondbacks are tasked with finding a weakness in this machine, and they are almost out of time to do so.", "summary": "The Dodgers score four runs in the fifth en route to an 8-5 win over the Diamondbacks and a commanding NLDS lead.\n(2:13)LOS ANGELES -- As Robbie Ray and the Arizona Diamondbacks are finding out, the Los Angeles Dodgers are like a baseball version of the Borg from \"Star Trek.\"\nFirst, the meat of the subject is that the Dodgers knocked off the Diamondbacks 8-5 on Saturday to seize a 2-0 lead in their National League Division Series matchup.\nAP Photo/Jae C.

(2:32)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Before Game 2, Bryce Harper said of his hitting: \"I think it could get better.\" Then it did.\n\nWith his Nationals trailing 3-1 in the bottom of eighth inning and on the verge of falling into the abyss of a two-game hole in the National League Division Series, Harper crushed a massive two-run bomb off Chicago Cubs reliever Carl Edwards Jr. that tied the game. Perhaps more importantly, the blast -- Harper's first extra-base hit since returning on Sept. 25 from a knee injury that forced him to miss six weeks -- seemed to open the flood gates for a Nats offense that was about to crumble under the pressure of the postseason, propelling the NL East champs to an epic 6-3 win and evening up the series.\n\nIt was a turnaround that, prior to Harper's heroics, nobody saw coming.\n\nIn Game 1, Dusty Baker's club looked like a shell of the team that ranked third in the majors in scoring, mustering just a pair of hits against Kyle Hendricks and friends in a 3-0 whitewashing. Despite the lack of production, Baker decided to wash(ington), rinse and repeat by fielding the exact same lineup on Saturday. Through the first seven innings of Game 2, it was more of the same, as the Nationals' only hits off starter Jon Lester were a solo home run by Anthony Rendon in the first and a fifth-inning single by Ryan Zimmerman. If ever a team was pressing, it was the Nationals.\n\n\"Just trying too hard,\" said leadoff man Trea Turner, who is 0-for-8 with four strikeouts in the series. \"You want to do so well, and you got to let the game come to you.\"\n\nIn the eighth inning of Game 2, it finally did.\n\nRyan Zimmerman celebrates his three-run home run in the eighth inning to put the Nationals ahead. Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports\n\nPinch hitter Adam Lind, who was making his first postseason appearance in 1,344 career games (most among active players), started things off by serving an 0-2 fastball from Edwards into left field for a single. That set the stage for Harper, who by his own admission hadn't been as ready for the spotlight as he would have liked since coming off the disabled list.\n\n\"The more at-bats I get, the more comfortable I get,\" said Harper before the game, having gone 3-for-18 with seven whiffs in five regular-season games after returning. \"Taking six weeks off, seven weeks off, not seeing live pitching is tough. You know, just got to go out there, see the ball, and try to hit it the best I can.\"\n\nIn Game 1, Harper was one of the only Nationals who did hit the ball, lining a first-inning single to right field that accounted for 50 percent of his team's base knocks. Although he went oh-fer in his first three trips on Saturday, the former MVP showed signs that he's starting to come around. After a four-pitch strikeout in the first inning, he stuck around for seven pitches before grounding out to shortstop in the fourth. Then in the sixth, he fouled off five offerings from Lester as part of an eight-pitch battle that ended with another grounder to short. In the eighth, when he jumped all over a 3-1 breaking ball from Edwards, he only needed five pitches to get the job done. And that's all the Nats needed to snap out of their deep lumber slumber.\n\n\"The tension and the frustration builds,\" said Zimmerman, \"and sometimes it takes kind of just one hit for everyone to exhale.\"\n\nThere was more than just exhaling going on at Nats Park. As soon as Harper made contact, the sellout crowd of 43,860, which had spent the first seven innings just waiting for a reason to lose it, did just that, springing to its feet as fireworks exploded from the top of the stadium. Inside the first-base dugout, the volume was just as loud.\n\n\"A lot of screaming,\" said Turner of how the Nationals reacted after Harper crossed home plate and came down the steps. \"It doesn't get more fun than that right there.\"\n\nExcept for when it does.\n\nRelieved and recharged by Harper's 421-foot depressurizer, the Nats' lineup poured it on. Rendon followed Harper's homer with a walk, which was followed by a single from Daniel Murphy, which was followed by a skyscraping three-run Zimmerman jack that just barely escaped the reach of left fielder Ben Zobrist and sailed over the left field fence. Even though Zimmerman's shot was technically the game winner, it was Harper's heroics that really seemed to get the Nats off the schneid.\n\n\"We just needed that spark,\" said starter Gio Gonzalez. \"It just took off from there. It's like a lighter. It just blew up right there. Bryce always steps up right when it's time. It's unbelievable what he does and how he does it. He's a story, a movie, everything all in one.\"\n\n\"Obviously a huge hit by him to kind of lift that pressure a little bit,\" added Zimmerman. \"One of the bigger homers he's ever hit.\"\n\nFor a player like Harper who has a flare for the dramatic, that's saying a lot.\n\nCounting his Game 2 game-changer, the 24-year-old slugger already has five postseason home runs, two more than anybody in Nats/Expos history. He also has five Opening Day dingers -- most among active players -- not to mention five career walk-off bombs. And that doesn't even include the ninth-inning, pinch-hit homer he clubbed against the Minnesota Twins last year to send the game into extras.\n\nBut of all Harper's clutch clouts, perhaps none was bigger than his eighth-inning job on Saturday, the one that broke the seal. The one that tied Game 2 and script-flipped the NLDS, pulling his team back from the brink of a 2-0 deficit and giving the Nationals -- who now fly to Chicago with visions of Game 3 starter Max Scherzer dancing in their heads -- a very real chance of winning their first playoff series ever.\n\nAfter the game, while his teammates were busy getting showered and changed in preparation for a late-night flight to Chicago, there was Harper, standing outside the Nationals' clubhouse in full uniform, sharing the moment with his father.\n\n\"I love you, Pop,\" Harper told his dad as he gave him a giant bear hug.\n\n\"I love you, Big Kid,\" Ron Harper told his son, squeezing him back.\n\nAfter the younger Harper had finally disappeared into the clubhouse, the elder Harper stood there a while longer and basked in the afterglow of his boy's latest storybook memory.\n\n\"I believe that he's built for those big moments,\" said Ron, who was Bryce's pitcher for the Home Run Derby at the 2013 All-Star Game. \"You've seen 'em the last five or six years.\"\n\nHarper's father talked about what he's most proud of is how his son has persevered. How he has been able to overcome the gruesome knee injury that, a couple of months ago, appeared to be devastating. How, just when he was ready to return, he got sick, and how he had barely a week to try to get his timing back.\n\nThen the elder Harper stated the obvious:\n\n\"It looks like he's starting to get it a little bit.\"", "summary": "Bryce Harper connects on a two-run homer to knot the game in the eighth inning and Ryan Zimmerman smacks a three-run long ball later in the same frame to put the Nationals on top 6-3 over the Cubs.\n(2:32)WASHINGTON -- Before Game 2, Bryce Harper said of his hitting: \"I think it could get better.\"\nRyan Zimmerman celebrates his three-run home run in the eighth inning to put the Nationals ahead.\n\"A lot of screaming,\" said Turner of how the Nationals reacted after Harper crossed home plate and came down the steps.\nThen the elder Harper stated the obvious:\"It looks like he's starting to get it a little bit.\"", "score": 0}, {"source": "ESPN", "title": "Your guide to Sunday's ALDS games: Win or go home for Red Sox and Yankees", "url": "http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/20934837/your-guide-sunday-alds-games-win-go-home-red-sox-yankees", "top_image_url": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0622%2Fr223128_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "description": "The Indians and Astros are one win away from booking trips to the ALCS.

Fister had a good stretch of games in late August and early September but allowed 17 runs in 16.2 innings over his final four starts. He's been clutch in the postseason before (2.60 ERA over 55 innings), but John Farrell will no doubt have Price ready in long relief.\n\nIf the Astros win: They sweep the Red Sox for their first series win since advancing to the World Series in 2005.\n\nIf the Red Sox win: They stay alive for another day with a likely matchup of Porcello versus Charlie Morton in Game 4.

He had a big platoon split this season with an OPS 258 points higher against lefties (.759 versus .501). You get the feeling Rafael Devers may have to pop one to give Boston a chance.\n\nThe prediction: In the year of the home run, the Red Sox seem to lack the firepower to compete with Houston's lineup.

(1:17)\n\nBOSTON -- The tire marks were still fresh on the players' chests last Oct. 11 when the Red Sox called dual Fenway Park news conferences to discuss the fallout from an American League Division Series whipping by the Cleveland Indians.\n\nJohn Farrell went first, and for roughly 25 minutes, the manager ducked, dipped, dove and dodged questions about his job security. Next up was president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, who announced Farrell would return, a bit of information that he casually relayed as the two passed each other en route to and from their respective press availabilities.\n\nAwkward? You bet. But it also underscored the matter-of-factness with which ownership and the front office regarded Farrell\u2019s standing within the organization. Fans were calling for his head on Twitter (#firefarrell had become a common hashtag), but Manager John -- as lefty David Price has taken to calling him -- was never in any real danger of losing his job.\n\nA year later, it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s still the case.\n\nJohn Farrell has led the Red Sox to two straight American League East titles, but he could potentially be pink-slipped if they suffer another division series sweep. AP Photo/Steve Nesius\n\nThe Red Sox appear to have an alarming affinity for d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. After winning 93 games and the American League East for a second season in a row, they once again have upchucked on their spikes on the road in the first two games of a best-of-five division series, putting their season on the brink of extinction as they return Sunday to Fenway for Game 3.\n\nBut unlike last year, when the Red Sox chalked up their postseason humiliation largely to the inexperience of their young core, it's more difficult to overlook this time that they simply are inferior to the Houston Astros, an offensive juggernaut with better starting pitching.\n\nAnd so, there is considerable curiosity within the industry about whether another division series sweep will bring sweeping change in Boston, beginning with the manager.\n\n\"I think he\u2019s done a great job,\" Dombrowski said of Farrell last week, before the playoffs began. \"He\u2019s a tough guy. He\u2019s a smart baseball man.\"\n\nFarrell has made a few head-scratching moves in the division series. He used Eduardo Nunez over Hanley Ramirez as the Game 1 designated hitter, even though Nunez had two at-bats in the past month because of a sprained knee ligament. Nunez's knee gave way again in the first inning, and he had to be carried off the field by Farrell and a trainer, although it was the medical staff, not Farrell, that cleared Nunez to play. In Game 2, Farrell took third baseman Rafael Devers out of the lineup against Astros lefty Dallas Keuchel, despite the rookie's strong numbers against lefties and his home run potential for a Red Sox team that is starved for power.\n\nBy and large, though, Farrell has had a good year. He has masterfully handled the bullpen, which played a pivotal role in engineering a 15-3 record in extra innings, and preached an aggressive mentality on the bases that helped the offense manufacture runs in the absence of homers.\n\nYou would never know it from the social media vitriol and sports talk radio jabber, which default to blaming Farrell for all of the Red Sox's ills.\n\nBut the team has far bigger issues than its manager.\n\nOwnership and Dombrowski decided in the offseason to get back below the luxury-tax threshold and never adequately replaced the retired David Ortiz. Without a true middle-of-the-order power threat, the Sox can't stand toe-to-toe with the slugging Stros. That's hardly Farrell's fault, and firing him won't solve anything if the Red Sox don't also sign outfielder J.D. Martinez, set to be a free agent this offseason, or pull off a blockbuster for Miami Marlins masher Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nBut if the Red Sox get broomed again, especially after back-to-back 8-2 blowouts in Houston that weren't as close as the score looked, change will have to come to a team that appears to be unpopular with its fan base and has produced sagging ratings on the New England Sports Network.\n\nFarrell has one year left on his contract after the Red Sox\u2019s decision in December to guarantee his 2018 club option. But Dombrowski inherited Farrell upon taking over late in the 2015 season, and rather than bringing him back as a lame duck next year, another sweep could represent an opportunity to hire a manager of his choice.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Over the past 12 years, Dombrowski has hired only two managers, one of whom is steadfastly retired (Jim Leyland) and the other who was just fired after a last-place finish with the Detroit Tigers (Brad Ausmus). Dombrowski remains friends with Baseball Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa, having worked with him with the Chicago White Sox in the 1980s. But the 73-year-old La Russa hasn\u2019t managed since 2011 with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nDombrowski also has learned over the past three seasons that managing the Red Sox is different than managing other teams. The criticism is harsher here, the second-guessing more rampant. There was a reason late Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino used to say that then-Red Sox manager Terry Francona\u2019s job was more difficult than his.\n\n\"Managing is a tough job, period. I think it\u2019s a tougher job here than maybe anywhere else,\" Dombrowski said. \"The scrutiny you receive. Being in the game as long as I\u2019ve been in the game, I\u2019m amazed somewhat [by] the scrutiny aspect of it.

Next to it, a bronze picture frame with photos of martyred friends, and a killed male soldier. Next to that, a poster of jailed Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan.\n\nThe eight members of the YJS heavy weapons unit - the oldest, Darsim, 26, the youngest, Ariyah, just 20 - were sat on the floor smoking and deftly personalising their famous scarves by braiding the edges, the ceiling fan helping to pass the hottest part of the day.\n\nThen it clicked: there was already a picture of these women known to the whole world. In it, four of them stand with straight backs, proud faces and hands flashing the \u2018V\u2019 for victory sign in front of the decorated wall. They hold posters condemning the recent racially-charged violence in Charlottesville, and their condolences for the death of Antifa activist, Heather Heyer. \u201cUnite against Fascism\u201d, one of the signs read in English.\n\n\u201cAs women who have suffered at the hands of Daesh [Isis] we know well the dangers that fascist, racist, patriarchal and nationalist groups and organisations pose. Once again men of this mind-set, this time in America, have martyred a woman, Heather Heyer, who was resisting against the division and destruction of communities.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Heather Heyer\u2019s struggle is our struggle and that the fight against fascism is a global battle. For this reason, we are calling on women around the world to unite against fascism and put an end to terrorist groups like Daesh and those made from the same cloth that kill women like Heather.\u201d\n\nUploaded by a Facebook account affiliated with the YPJ, or Kurdish Women\u2019s Protection Units, after which it was shared thousands of times, the call to arms from Raqqa\u2019s front line reinvigorated anti-fascist movements around the world. Punch Nazis, defeat Isis: two sides of the same coin, many on the left figured.\n\nAnd here they were, in the flesh, these women from the famous picture. Did they know about the impact it had?\n\nNo, it turns out. Raqqa hasn\u2019t had functioning communications towers or cellular data service since al Nusra, and then Isis, seized control the city four years ago. And when you\u2019re posted to the front line as the jihadists struggle to retain control of their de facto capital, there isn\u2019t a lot of time to focus on news from the outside world.\n\nAll eight members of the unit still have sisters, cousins and friends still suffering at Isis\u2019 hands. With no contact for years at this point, they have no idea where their missing female relatives are, or whether they\u2019re even still alive.\n\n\u201cDaesh are monsters,\u201d said Darsim Erezan.\n\n\u201cThere have been 73 separate massacres of Yazidis. We are trying to protect our people, and we want revenge.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s complex civil war, now in its seventh year, is unlike any other modern conflict, and its full repercussions are yet to be understood. Almost 500,000 people have been killed and half of the pre-war population of 22 million have been driven from their homes.\n\nYazidi women are perhaps the most persecuted of all of those who have suffered in the war. As Isis evolved out of Syria\u2019s violence, they began to impose their poisonous beliefs on the communities under their control.\n\nThe violence committed against the Yazidi people \u2013 a minority population whose beliefs combine elements of Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism \u2013 amounts to genocide, international lawyers agree.\n\nLadies who lunch. A Yazidi YJS (Singar women's protection unit) takes a break for food in east Raqqa pic.twitter.com/OTKIwp4j3Y \u2014 Bethan McKernan (@mck_beth) September 20, 2017\n\nIsis decimated Yazidi villages in Sinjar, on the Iraqi-Syrian border, after it managed to blitz into Iraq in 2014. Men were lined up and shot and thousands of women kidnapped to serve as slaves who are both sexually and physically abused.\n\nThe stories of those who managed to escape are chilling. All but one of the YJS unit were trapped on Sinjar mountain by militants without food or water as they waited desperately for Kurdish Peshmerga and YPG forces to assist the evacuation; they were lucky to escape alive.\n\n\u201cBefore Isis came I was just in school,\u201d said Nagasin, one of the unit\u2019s two snipers. \u201cI never thought I would learn how to use weapons and be independent. Now we can trust ourselves. We know we can fight.\u201d\n\nLearning how to defend themselves thanks to training from the Kurdish Women\u2019s Protection units (YPJ) and joining the fight for Raqqa has changed the trajectory of these women\u2019s lives.\n\nTiny Ayidza, the only foreigner of the group, from the Yazidi community in Germany\u2019s Black Forest, demonstrates how to use the dozens of rocket launchers and guns, which sit in what looks like it used to be a teenager\u2019s bedroom.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that the room could have recently belonged to any of the fighters; the median age of the unit is 20. While they prepared lunch all of the women padded around in brightly coloured animal pattern socks that made a striking contrast with their US-issued polyester fatigues.\n\nAyidza went on to point out the new graffiti on the side of a mosque next door that is mostly intact despite intense US-led coalition bombing which has destroyed entire neighbourhoods and coated what\u2019s left in building dust.\n\nIsis 'poster girl' Sally Jones wants to leave Raqqa and return to UK, friend claims\n\n\u201cResistance is life,\u201d it says, in Kurdish, English and Greek \u2013 most likely the work of an foreign fighter from an international unit stationed nearby.\n\nThe house, too, is covered in slogans and \u2018YJS\u2019, one accompanied by a smiley face. It\u2019s a sign of quite how complicated things are in Raqqa: the last few jihadis left in the city are being hunted down thanks to the SDF coalition of Kurdish, Arab, Turkmen, Assyrian and Yazidi fighters, which the Pentagon says numbers 40,000.\n\nBut even when civilians are able to return to the heavily mined city, Raqqa is a majority Arab town, and with Isis on the backfoot at some point the Syrian government will turn its attention back to it.\n\nThe SDF cannot stay here indefinitely. Which means it is unclear what lies ahead for its soldiers, too.\n\nMost of the Yazidi and Arab recruits, liberated from the jihadists, were keen to join the Kurds in the fight against them. Syria\u2019s war is far from over, and especially for recruits originally from Iraq, renewed conflict with Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government is not necessarily something they have signed up for.\n\nEither way, life is very different for the YJS now.\n\n\u201cIf we as women had been armed and knew how to defend ourselves in the beginning, maybe the massacres against us would not have happened.\n\n\u201cWe have proved to the whole world we can protect ourselves now.\u201d", "summary": "The flags and pictures on the wall of the Raqqa home serving as a Yazidi women\u2019s unit seemed familiar, even though they couldn\u2019t be.\nA big red Sinjar Women\u2019s Protection units (YJS) flag, with its spiky yellow sun on a green background in the middle.\nThen it clicked: there was already a picture of these women known to the whole world.\nAll eight members of the unit still have sisters, cousins and friends still suffering at Isis\u2019 hands.\nYazidi women are perhaps the most persecuted of all of those who have suffered in the war.", "score": 0}, {"source": "Independent", "title": "Labour pull five points clear of the Tories, as voters prefer Corbyn to May", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-tories-poll-latest-lead-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-pm-general-election-five-points-bmg-a7988166.html", "top_image_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/04/18/corbyn-1.jpg", "description": "Theresa May\u2019s crisis has deepened today with a new poll showing Labour surging ahead of the Conservatives, while the public now also has a clear preference for Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister.

Mr Shapps was told to \u201cshut up\u201d by former leadership hopeful Andrea Leadsom, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also pleaded for more unity in the party.\n\nUK news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30 show all UK news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/30 6 October 2017 An order of service is carried ahead of the funeral service for Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn, real name Sylvia Ann Ibbetson, outside Salford Cathedral.

A Senate committee voted to advance her nomination to be a federal judge.\n\nBut Republicans don\u2019t need Democrats\u2019 votes, and now Barrett, a 45-year-old law professor at the University of Notre Dame, is all but certain to be confirmed to a lifetime post on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit \u2014 a court one level below the Supreme Court.\n\nBarrett is the model judicial candidate for this White House: young, conservative, and opposed to abortion and LGBTQ rights. For all the stories about President Donald Trump using his executive power to roll back civil rights protections \u2014 in the past day, his administration axed the ACA birth control benefit and ended workplace protections for transgender people \u2014 it is here, on the courts, where his team is working most aggressively to reshape the country.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s speed in nominating judges has been perhaps the most successful aspect of his presidency,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who specializes in judicial nominations. \u201cTrump has easily surpassed Obama, Bush and Clinton at this point in the first year of their presidencies in terms of the sheer number nominated.\u201d\n\nHe has. Ten months in, Trump has nominated 17 circuit court judges and 39 district court judges. That\u2019s far more than former President Barack Obama\u2019s seven circuit court nominees and four district court nominees by this point in his first year of office. Former President George W. Bush had nominated 11 circuit judges and 31 district judges by this point.\n\nHe\u2019s also got more court seats to fill. He inherited a whopping 108 court vacancies when he became president \u2015 double the number of vacancies Obama inherited when he took office. That\u2019s largely due to Republicans\u2019 years-long strategy of denying votes to Obama\u2019s court picks to keep those seats empty for a future GOP president to fill. It worked.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s current judicial nominees are a preview of the kinds of judges he plans to nominate in the coming years, prepare for a significantly more socially conservative group of people shaping the nation\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Senate also confirmed Kevin Newsom, 44, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in August. He wrote a 2000 law review article equating the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 decision upholding slavery. He also argued in a 2005 article for the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization, that Title IX does not protect people who face retaliation for reporting gender discrimination. The Supreme Court later rejected that position.\n\nRalph Erickson, 58, was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in September. As a district judge in 2016, he was one of two judges in the country who ordered the federal government not to enforce health care nondiscrimination protections for transgender people.\n\nCSPAN Here's U.S. circuit court judge John Bush testifying in his Senate confirmation hearing in June. He thinks abortion is like slavery, and they are \u201cthe two greatest tragedies in our country.\u201d\n\nThese are just judges that have been confirmed. Nominees in the queue include Leonard Grasz, Trump\u2019s pick for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. Grasz, 56, proposed amending the Omaha City Charter in 2013 to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people. He has also compared the \u201cpersonhood\u201d of fetuses to the civil rights of Native Americans and African-Americans, according to an exhaustive report issued by the Alliance for Justice, a left-leaning advocacy group that focuses on the federal judiciary.\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to shift the federal bench to the right isn\u2019t just aimed at district and circuit courts. He nominated Damien Schiff, a 37-year-old attorney, to a 15-year gig on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Schiff has criticized efforts to prevent bullying of LGBTQ students, referring to messages of equality as \u201cteaching \u2018gayness\u2019 in schools.\u201d He also argued that states should be allowed to criminalize \u201cconsensual sodomy.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason the White House has been able to nominate so many judges, so quickly, is because it\u2019s been focused on filling court vacancies in states represented by two Republican senators. It\u2019s easier for Trump\u2019s team to work with Republicans in picking nominees, and then in moving them forward in committee, where it takes both home-state senators turning in a \u201cblue slip\u201d to get the hearing process going.\n\nTrump has been less successful in confirming nominees, though. That\u2019s partly because in the mad rush to fill courts seats, the White House isn\u2019t reviewing nominees\u2019 records as thoroughly as, say, the Obama administration did. That means more controversial nominees and more scrutiny. Democrats aren\u2019t exactly eager to cooperate, either, given the way Republicans treated Obama\u2019s judicial nominees (remember Merrick Garland?).\n\nBut as Trump plows through judicial nominations that will be a part of his legacy for decades, the only thing Democrats can do while they\u2019re in the minority, for the most part, is make noise.", "summary": "Ten months in, Trump has nominated 17 circuit court judges and 39 district court judges.\nThat\u2019s far more than former President Barack Obama\u2019s seven circuit court nominees and four district court nominees by this point in his first year of office.\nFormer President George W.

Why did he kill all those people?\n\n\u201cBecause I love my wife and I love my children,\u201d he replied matter-of-factly.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t about love at all. Cory had just been arrested for committing a massacre. He was accused of slaughtering eight people: his wife\u2019s mother, her older sister and her aunt, her cousin and her cousin\u2019s husband, her pastor\u2019s grandson and another young boy, as well as the officer who responded to the 911 call.\n\nIt was early morning on May 28 and Cory sat on the street in handcuffs outside his cousin-in-law\u2019s house in Brookhaven, Mississippi, a small town nicknamed \u201cA Home Seekers Paradise.\u201d Police stood guard with guns drawn.\n\nAll night long they\u2019d been on a manhunt for Cory after responding to reports that he had opened fire on his wife\u2019s family in the neighboring hamlet of Bogue Chitto. Eight people were dead by the time he was arrested, a little before 7 a.m.\n\nBut why did Cory say it was love that led him to kill so many? Only one person understood.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want nobody else around us,\u201d Cory\u2019s wife, Sheena Godbolt, said sitting on her sister\u2019s couch one scorching hot afternoon in July, almost two months after the shooting.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me there with him, with no friends or family members, nothing,\u201d she said. She shifted in her seat, drew a deep breath, shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not love.\u201d\n\nThere have been eight mass shootings in the United States this year. That night in Mississippi was the fifth. Everytown for Gun Safety defines a mass shooting as a single incident in which four or more people are fatally shot, not including the perpetrator. The most recent mass shooting occurred earlier this month in Las Vegas, when a gunman opened fire on concertgoers at a country music festival. With 58 fatalities, it earned the unenviable title of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nBut what happened in Las Vegas is nothing like what most mass shootings look like in America. Most resemble what police say took place in Mississippi. This year, in five of the eight mass shootings, the perpetrators killed their girlfriends, wives, children and extended family members.\n\nThis year\u2019s pattern is not unusual. Between 2009 and 2016, the perpetrator shot a current or former intimate partner or family member in 54 percent of mass shootings. Everytown also found that in nearly half of these cases, the perpetrator exhibited warning signs before the killing, such as recent acts of violence, threats or violation of a protective order.\n\nMass shootings are rare, of course, and make up only a fraction of overall gun violence in America. But when they do occur, the primary victims are usually not strangers like the victims in Las Vegas; they are those closest to the perpetrator.\n\nMelissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Sheena Godbolt, 33, sits on her sister's porch in Bogue Chitto.\n\nCory was Sheena\u2019s first and only boyfriend. They started dating when they were teenagers. In the beginning, he was adoring and generous. \u201cHe bought me my first cell phone,\u201d Sheena recalled. \u201cIf I needed clothes, he took me to Walmart.\u201d\n\nBut over the years things began to change. They got married and had two children. He started to become more possessive. She had to ask his permission to go anywhere, she said. He was jealous of her friendships and her relationships with her family. As she describes it, her life shrank to fit the four walls of their mobile home.\n\nNeighbors said they could hear Cory screaming at her sometimes. He\u2019d yell at her to change her clothes if he could see the outline of her body. He\u2019d snatch her phone out of her hand to check her texts, she said. And when he got really angry, he\u2019d punch things: the walls of their trailer, and sometimes, she said, her too. She wore long sleeves to cover the marks he left behind \u2013 even through Mississippi summers. She learned to anticipate when he was likely to get violent. If she saw the telltale signs \u2015 a narrowing of his eyes, a particular tone in his voice \u2015 she\u2019d take off in her car.\n\nOver the course of their 17 years together, Sheena left Cory a half dozen times. (It\u2019s a typical pattern. On average, it takes victims of domestic violence seven attempts before leaving for good.) She would hop in the car and drive; it didn\u2019t matter where. Once she wound up in Louisiana, three hours away, before she calmed down. It was safest to stay in hotels or pass the time at a rest stop. If she and the kids bunked with friends or family, Cory might turn against them, she said.\n\nThe man held grudges. Sheena\u2019s relatives didn\u2019t like how Cory treated her, and he got in altercations with several of them through the years. Sheena usually sided with him out of loyalty. When her family tried to intervene, it just made everything harder.\n\nSheena\u2019s family pressed charges against him on a few occasions. In 2015, Cory confronted Myrtis May, one of Sheena\u2019s aunts, and \u201cmade threats to kill her,\u201d according to a court document. He was convicted of simple assault, attempting by physical menace to create fear, and fined $467.75.\n\nSheena rarely involved the police herself; she said Cory told her they couldn\u2019t protect her. But in 2016, Cory reached a new level of violence, she said. That year, she obtained a temporary protection-from-abuse order. She told police that Cory had punched her in the stomach and strangled her \u2015 all because she would not give him the security code to her cell phone. \u201cShe states he also put his hand down her mouth where she couldn\u2019t scream for help,\u201d a court document states.\n\n\u201cHe tortured me that day,\u201d Sheena said.\n\nHe was charged with domestic violence, aggravated assault, but the charges were later dropped. Sheena forgave him for that incident, too.\n\n\u201cHe was my husband and I loved him,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted our marriage to work.\u201d\n\nAfterward, the violence got worse, she said, and eventually she came to the realization that she had to abandon the marriage to save herself.\n\nA few weeks before the May 2017 rampage, she left again, this time for the last time. She sought refuge with her mother, Barbara Mitchell, who was recovering from open heart surgery. For three weeks, she stayed at her mother\u2019s home without incident.\n\nAnd then they decided to throw a party.\n\nAlissa Scheller/HuffPost\n\nThe Massacre\n\nIt was Memorial Day weekend in Bogue Chitto where Sheena was raised, around 60 miles south of Jackson, Mississippi. That Saturday, her mom held a barbecue in the yard. Friends and family came over, bringing food to grill. By 11:30 p.m., the festivities were winding down, and only around 10 people remained. Sheena\u2019s mother, Barbara Mitchell, was resting in the living room. Her sister, Toccara May, was chatting out in the yard with her aunt, Brenda May. Vincent Mitchell, Sheena\u2019s stepfather, was in the kitchen with his brother, who was visiting.\n\nSheena was putting her kids to bed in the guest room when Cory arrived at the door.\n\nShe recalled how he strode into the living room and demanded Sheena give him their kids. This was a classic tactic of his, she said. Whenever she\u2019d leave him, he\u2019d take the kids from her; if she wanted to see them, she had to come home. It used to work. But Sheena wasn\u2019t going back again; she wanted a divorce. So that night, when Cory showed up, she called the police. She knew her husband. She knew he wouldn\u2019t leave without a fight.\n\nAround nine minutes after her call to 911, Deputy Sheriff William Durr of the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office pulled up and asked Cory to leave. Then, without warning, her husband pulled out a gun and shot Durr, Sheena said. Everyone scattered into various rooms, seeking cover. Sheena bolted toward her kids in the guest room, ripping them out of bed and pushing them out the window.\n\n\u201cAs we were jumping the fence and running through the woods, I was hearing gunshots, gunshots, gunshots,\u201d Sheena recalled. \u201cThat was my last time seeing my family.\u201d\n\nLater, authorities would confirm that Barbara Mitchell, Brenda May and Toccara May had been killed along with Deputy Durr. And that was just the beginning.\n\nAfter Sheena and the children emerged from the woods and were huddling in the street in shock, neighbors, friends and relatives rushed to their side. Sheena had cut her wrist when she jumped out the window and was bleeding badly. For hours, they stood together, praying and crying. The house had been cordoned off by the police. They didn\u2019t yet know who had been slain, and they didn\u2019t know where Cory had gone.\n\nAmong those gathered to support Sheena was Tiffany Blackwell, a family friend whose father was the pastor of New Zion Union M.B. Church, which Sheena and Cory attended. Tiffany and her husband, Shon Blackwell, drove over as soon as they heard the news, leaving their children at home in Brookhaven overnight.\n\nWhile many details are still unclear, it appears Cory drove to the Blackwells\u2019 home next. No one else knows why he went there, but when he arrived, he shot at the locked door until he was able to kick it in, according to Caleb Edwards, 15, one of Tiffany\u2019s nephews. Once inside, he shot Tiffany\u2019s son Jordan, 18, who in a heroic gesture used his body to shield Caleb and Caleb\u2019s 11-year-old brother, Austin. Caleb survived with a cut to his eye, but both Jordan and Austin were killed.\n\nCory was not finished. According to witnesses, he took another teen, a friend of the boys who was there that night, at gunpoint and forced him to drive them around for hours. About 6 a.m., Cory let the teen go at a gas station near his third and final stop: the home of Sheena\u2019s cousins Sheila and Ferral Burage.\n\nSheila, her husband and her sister Shonda May had been in Bogue Chitto all night with Sheena. Along with many other friends and family members, they had gone to offer their support. At dawn they went home, but soon after they heard a knock at the door. It was Cory. Ferral was armed and ready because he knew Cory was still on the run. He fired at Cory, Shonda said, but Cory shot back and killed Ferral. The sisters ran. Shonda hid in a closet while Sheila sought cover in the bathroom. While Shonda was not discovered, Sheila was, and Cory fatally shot her too, police say.\n\nCory was apprehended minutes later down the street from the Burages\u2019 home by members of multiple law enforcement agencies. He sat in the street, bleeding from the arm where Ferral had shot him and muttering about his family. He was later charged with one count of capital murder and seven counts of first-degree murder.\n\n\u201cThey would not let me live and let live!\u201d he yelled, according to video taken by Clarion-Ledger reporter Therese Apel at the scene. \u201cI just wanted to love my family. I just wanted to love my wife.\u201d\n\nThe high death toll made national headlines briefly and then faded out of the news cycle. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) called it a \u201csenseless tragedy\u201d and asked his constituents to pray for those who had died. Maybe because of the people who were targeted \u2015 the family of the killer\u2019s wife \u2015 the shooting was, somehow, relegated to the realm of the domestic.\n\nLincoln County Sheriff's Office A mugshot of Willie Cory Godbolt from a 2016 arrest.\n\nA Community Mourns\n\nIn Bogue Chitto, where Sheena and Cory lived, the community felt rattled to its core. They had all either grown up together or went to the same school or church. Losing eight people at once \u2015 from children to a police officer \u2015 left a gaping wound. On Highway 51, across from a gas station and tanning salon popular with locals, someone erected a memorial: eight blazing white crosses in a row.\n\nWhen HuffPost visited in July, Cory was due in court for a preliminary hearing. At Lincoln County Circuit Court in Brookhaven, more than five dozen relatives of the slain filed into the courtroom and waited in tense silence.\n\nOver the previous two months, they had buried the dead, mourned, held community prayer meetings and tried to make sense of what had happened. Now, for many of them, it was the first chance to lay eyes on the man charged with killing their loved ones.\n\nCory entered the room in shackles, wearing a yellow shirt and khaki pants. He scanned the room as though looking for someone. Shonda May shook uncontrollably. Tressie Durr, the widow of the slain deputy sheriff, silently wiped away tears. Vincent Mitchell stared at Cory with fury.\n\nThe hearing was brief. An officer from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation recited the bare details of the shootings: the locations, the names of the deceased, the evidence indicating Cory to be the sole perpetrator. Boxes of tissues were passed down the aisles.\n\nAfterward, many relatives gathered at the Burages\u2019 house in Brookhaven to eat ribs and fried catfish and to reminisce about those who had lived there before it became a crime scene. The house was the final stop on the killing spree. Months after the shooting, there was no trace of the tragedy.\n\nShonda stood outside on the lawn. She didn\u2019t want to go inside. She was there when Cory burst in. She had hidden in a closet as her sister Sheila and brother-in-law Ferral were killed. Seeing Cory in the courtroom had shaken her badly.\n\n\u201cI felt very nervous to where I felt like my heart jump out of my chest,\u201d she told HuffPost, as she stood in the shade of the front yard staring back at the house.\n\nInside, Shon Blackwell sat looking through photos of his late son on his phone. Jordan, who was killed that night in the Blackwells\u2019 home, was a rising football star at Brookhaven High School, and had recently received scholarship offers from a number of universities. He had dreamed of playing professional football or, if that didn\u2019t pan out, going into coaching, his father said.\n\nShon, an assistant pastor at New Zion Union M.B. Church, said he was leaning heavily on scripture in the aftermath of the shooting and finding solace in the church. Every day was getting a little bit easier, but not better.\n\n\u201cIt has caused us to depend more on God and less on ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the hearing that day, Shon posted a Facebook Live video online from his car. He said he arrived at the courthouse early so that he would have time to pray before seeing Cory face to face.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me how I feel. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m supposed to feel. If anyone else knows how I am supposed to feel, ask them to please share with me.\u201d\n\nMelissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Sheena and Cory's mobile home burned down after the shooting.\n\nOfficer Down\n\nBehind the courthouse, the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office was selling car decals emblazoned with William Durr\u2019s name and patrol number and the words \u201dA hero remembered lives forever.\u201d\n\nDurr, who had responded to Sheena\u2019s call for help, was the first officer killed on duty in the history of the department, Sheriff Steve Rushing told HuffPost. Law enforcement from as far away as New York and Chicago attended his funeral, along with the governor of Mississippi.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it shook us,\u201d Rushing said. \u201cYou know in this line of work that it can happen, but you don\u2019t really realize until it does happen how it affects you.\u201d\n\nEveryone at the sheriff\u2019s office was deeply distressed by Durr\u2019s death, he said. In the months since the shooting, his officers had stepped up to support Durr\u2019s wife and 10-year-old son, Nash.\n\nIn August, they would even chaperone Noah to his first day of sixth grade.\n\n\u201cWe miss William everyday, but especially on days like today,\u201d Tressie Durr wrote on Facebook that day. \u201cI am so thankful for our blue family.\u201d\n\nThe Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office is a lean operation, with 21 deputies responsible for patrolling 500 square miles. Three deputies are on each night, and they travel in separate cars to cover more ground. Most calls involve accidents or general complaints, but there\u2019s also a fair amount of domestic violence. The majority of the domestic violence calls are fairly straightforward, Rushing said. But even so, it\u2019s standard procedure to send two officers to the scene, as domestic violence is known to be the most dangerous type of call for police.\n\nThe night of the massacre, two deputies were dispatched to the house of Barbara and Vincent Mitchell. Durr arrived first. A second officer pulled up about five minutes later, he said, but by that time Durr had been shot.\n\nThe department was familiar with Cory; deputies had responded to calls from Sheena before. Over the years, he was arrested a dozen times and accused of simple assault, disturbing the peace, domestic violence and robbery. Still, Rushing said, he didn\u2019t expect Cory to do this.\n\n\u201cA lot of us knew him,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cI personally had met him in the community several times. Some of my officers went to church with him.\u201d\n\nMelissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Vincent Mitchell looks at his wife's grave at a cemetery in Bogue Chitto.\n\nLeft Behind\n\nEveryone in Bogue Chitto dealt with the tragedy in their own way.\n\nSome turned to the church for support. The police community took care of its own. But Sheena \u2015 who had lost her mother, her sister, her aunt and, in a sense, her husband \u2015 no longer felt like she belonged anywhere.\n\nFirst of all, she was homeless. Two weeks after the shooting, her mobile home burned down. An investigation found it to be \u201cundetermined in cause,\u201d but Sheena suspected arson. In a way, she understood. She was learning by that point what grief and rage did to a person. How it roiled inside of you, ugly and unknowable, and could spark fleeting thoughts of retaliation. Sheena preferred denial. Sometimes, for a moment, she allowed herself to imagine her family intact, her mother on the way home from the store.\n\nVisiting her mother\u2019s grave made it real again. Seven of the victims are buried in the same place, and it is a stark vision: a gathering of fresh graves covered in bright flowers inside an old cemetery.\n\nWhen HuffPost met with Sheena, she had just driven back from Jackson, where she had requested copies of her children\u2019s birth certificates. They\u2019d been lost in the fire, along with all her belongings \u2015 clothes, furniture and family photos. She was slowly working to replace those things. She had taken a leave of absence from her job at a local Walmart distribution center and was seeing a therapist. Some days, she said, she struggled to get out of bed.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a ton of bricks on top of me,\u201d she said, sitting at her sister\u2019s house. \u201cIt won\u2019t let me up and live again.\u201d\n\nThe what ifs race through her mind all the time. What if she hadn\u2019t left? What if she\u2019d gone to a hotel? What if she\u2019d said yes when Cory asked for the kids? What if she\u2019d never met him?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard ever since that day, because I feel like it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she said. She knows, rationally, that she\u2019s not to blame. But she still can\u2019t stop feeling that way. And it doesn\u2019t help that others seem to think so too.\n\nNo one comes out and blames her directly, but she feels it, she said. People hold her accountable. Some of her friends don\u2019t call anymore. She can only guess why. She wonders if it\u2019s simply because they don\u2019t know what to say.\n\nOn a recent weekend, Sheena spoke to HuffPost by phone. She had heard about a mass shooting in Texas committed by an estranged husband and wanted to contact the mother of the woman who was killed. No one else really understood what she was going through, and she hoped the woman\u2019s family might.\n\nSince HuffPost visited Sheena in July, she has moved to a different town and enrolled her son and daughter in a new school. The children, now in the third and fifth grades, are settling in. The move is good for the children, she said. It gives them anonymity. Other kids don\u2019t know them as the children of a mass murderer, she said.\n\nShe has also found a different church. She\u2019s back at work after almost four months off. She is an adult alone for the first time in her life. In a way, Cory has gotten exactly what he wanted. She\u2019s isolated from nearly everyone she knows and loves.\n\n\u201cWhat Cory did, that was on Cory,\u201d she said. \u201cHe left me and those babies here to suffer from his actions.\u201d\n\nSheena misses her own mother like a physical ache, she said. She used to call her daily on her lunch break.

It was earlier that he betrayed the magnitude of the events of the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nAfter a controlled performance to take his fourth victory in five races, Hamilton drove his Mercedes into the pits and stopped by the marker board that indicates the winner. And then he just sat there, the fingers from both hands in the narrow slot in his helmet, as he gave himself a moment to take in what had happened.\n\nHe climbed out of the car, stood on the top of the monocoque and then crouched down, his arms out to his sides as if he was flying. And then he knelt by the side of the car, his still-helmeted head resting on the sidepod, as if he was praying. A man of faith, he could well have been.\n\nBy then, his title rival Sebastian Vettel had already left the track. Before he did, the German spoke briefly to some television crews. And he, too, said all the right things: of course the title is harder now, but it's not over yet; we still have a chance; we can be strong for the final four races.\n\nDeep down, though, both men know what Suzuka meant. Hamilton has extended his championship lead to 59 points with only 100 still available. Barring some kind of miracle collapse, the 32-year-old Briton will surely win a fourth title this year. It is just a question of when.\n\nMercedes' Hamilton has now won eight races this season\n\nThe Ferrari collapse\n\nHamilton spoke for everyone after the race when he said it was \"kind of unbelievable\" how he has ended up in this situation. The season has turned so suddenly it is no wonder he is having difficulty taking it in.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Vettel was leading the championship - as he had done all season - having pressured Hamilton all the way at the Belgian Grand Prix on a track on which Mercedes were expected to dominate.\n\nThe expectation then was that the title fight would go to the last race, the momentum swinging back and forth all the while, the result impossible to predict.\n\nBut following Hamilton's dominant victory in Italy, Ferrari's season has imploded in three races in Asia in the past four weeks in quite astonishing fashion.\n\nFerrari team-mates Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were involved with a crash with Max Verstappen at the start of the Singapore Grand Prix and both had to retire from the race\n\nFirst came Singapore. Vettel had long been considered a certainty for victory there and he duly took pole position. But he made a catastrophic misjudgement off the start, veering aggressively across to defend from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, not realising that the other Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen was on the Dutchman's inside.\n\nVerstappen was boxed in. The three collided, all of them out of the race pretty much on the spot, and Hamilton drove through the melee to open up a 28-point lead.\n\nIt was a racing incident, an unfortunate coming together of circumstances, and Vettel is right to say that it is just one of those things that can happen. But it is also true to say that level of aggression brings with it a level of risk which, in the circumstances, Vettel perhaps should not have taken.\n\nTwo weeks later in Malaysia, Ferrari again had the fastest car and ought to have taken a relatively comfortable one-two. But an engine problem in qualifying consigned Vettel to the back of the grid, from where he recovered to fourth. And an identical one then took care of Raikkonen before the start. Either man would have beaten Hamilton on a day on which Mercedes had only the third-fastest car. Instead, he took second place.\n\nNow the gap was 34 points. And Vettel was lucky to get away without damaging his gearbox in a bizarre crash on the slowing-down lap with Williams' Lance Stroll which looks increasingly like the four-time champion's fault the more evidence emerges.\n\nThen on to Japan, and a spark plug failure on the grid for Vettel. Could he have beaten Hamilton had the car run cleanly? No-one will ever know, but he would have run him close. As it is, Ferrari have returned to Maranello before the next race in Austin, Texas, to lick their wounds and try to halt this collapse.\n\nTo make matters worse, Vettel received a reprimand for missing the driver line-up for the national anthem before the race at Suzuka. One more this season for a driving offence and he will get a 10-place grid penalty.\n\nFerrari mechanics were working on Vettel's car on the grid before Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix\n\nIs anyone at fault for Ferrari's campaign collapsing so spectacularly?\n\nWell, Vettel gave away 13 points with his moment of madness in driving into Hamilton behind the safety car in Azerbaijan in June, which turned a certain win into fourth place the way things turned out. And 25 points potentially went missing in Singapore.\n\nHad the 30-year-old German not made those two misjudgements, even with the engine problems in Malaysia and Japan the gap would now be at most 14 points. It would be very much game on.\n\nAnd that's assuming Hamilton would have finished second at Marina Bay, which was in no way a foregone conclusion had a healthy Verstappen and Raikkonen still been in the race.\n\nOf course, you can play 'what if' all day long. And the cliches are true. It is what it is. These things happen in motor racing. Drivers make mistakes. Cars sometimes break down.\n\nWhether Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne sees it that way remains to be seen. He was \"angry\" after the problems in Malaysia and said \"organisational changes\" were being made to address it. Will heads roll after Japan? It is the sort of thing that has happened in the past at Ferrari.\n\nHamilton re-focused and formidable\n\nHamilton has four wins from five races since F1's summer break\n\nHamilton has not been perfect this season either, but his difficulties have manifested themselves in a different way. His big points losses have so far come in the first part of the season and when the car was at its most difficult.\n\nThe Mercedes might be the fastest car over one lap this season, at least with Hamilton in it. But the Ferrari is a more consistent and usable - and often faster - race car, with a wider operating window.\n\nAnd when Mercedes have struggled this year, until the summer break Hamilton had often been affected more than team-mate Valtteri Bottas.\n\nHe had relatively weak weekends to one degree or another in Russia, Monaco, Austria and Hungary. At all of those grands prix he was out-qualified by the Finn as Mercedes struggled with a lack of grip and balance, rooted to a large degree in struggles to get the tyres in the right operating window.\n\nSince the summer break, though, Hamilton has been a man transformed - on \"another level,\" as he himself put it in Japan. His qualifying advantages over Bottas have been 0.5 seconds, 2.3secs (in the wet), 0.7secs, 0.5secs and 0.3secs.\n\nHis race performances have been equally dominant - he has four wins and a second place from the past five and, other than at Monza in Italy, none have come easily.\n\n\"He hasn't put a foot wrong since a lot of races,\" says Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff. \"He has out-performed the car at times and the combination of Lewis and Mercedes is a really strong package.\n\n\"We just have to keep the momentum to the end of the season.\"\n\nHow might the title run-in go?\n\nIf Hamilton's fourth world title now appears an inevitability, winning it might not happen as soon as it appears.\n\nAssuming Ferrari can get a handle on their reliability problems, they can be expected to be competitive at the next race, the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. In which case, it is hard to see Hamilton gaining the 16 points over Vettel he needs to clinch the title there.\n\nAfter that comes Mexico, about which Mercedes have serious concerns. The long straights might suggest a power track that will play to the silver car's strengths. But in fact, because of the high altitude, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City is a track where teams run at maximum downforce. And Ferrari - and Red Bull, for that matter - have a better high-downforce package than Mercedes.\n\nThe Mercedes engineers, therefore, have concerns that Mexico could be another weekend like Russia, Monaco, Hungary and Singapore where they are on the back foot. In which case, all things being equal, Hamilton could struggle even to make the podium.\n\nThere are aspects of the tracks at Brazil and Abu Dhabi - particularly the twisty sectors, in the middle of the lap at Interlagos and the end at Yas Marina - that are also likely to favour Ferrari and Red Bull. So the whole \"one race at a time\" mantra is more than merely the usual sportsman's schtick.\n\n\"There's not really any need for me to change the approach,\" Hamilton said on Sunday in Japan.\n\n\"The points are still what you go out there to achieve, but also you try and look after your car. I just don't think there's any need to make any changes. I'm not really particularly taking crazy risks in order to be in the position I'm in.\n\n\"So, yeah, I think we're just going to try and continue to do what we're doing. Of course, we want to try and look after the car and the engine. But I'm already doing that throughout the races so there's not really much more I can do. And I think if sometimes you come off the gas a little bit you actually cause yourself more trouble than you need.\n\n\"There's still a long way to go. One hundred points is a lot of points. Anything can happen in life. I've just got to try and keep my head down and hopefully continue to perform like this - but I feel very, very fortunate and really blessed and I'm enjoying the experience.\"", "summary": "It was earlier that he betrayed the magnitude of the events of the Japanese Grand Prix.\nTwo weeks later in Malaysia, Ferrari again had the fastest car and ought to have taken a relatively comfortable one-two.\nFerrari mechanics were working on Vettel's car on the grid before Sunday's Japanese Grand PrixIs anyone at fault for Ferrari's campaign collapsing so spectacularly?\nBut the Ferrari is a more consistent and usable - and often faster - race car, with a wider operating window.\nIn which case, it is hard to see Hamilton gaining the 16 points over Vettel he needs to clinch the title there.", "score": 0}, {"source": "BBC Sport", "title": "Grand Final 2017: Leeds Rhinos' journey from relegation danger to Old Trafford glory", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/41542961", "top_image_url": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13C92/production/_98224018_leedsrhinoscelebrategetty.jpg", "description": "Commitment, bloody-mindedness and 'holding your nerve' - how Brian McDermott's Leeds Rhinos won a record eighth Grand Final.", "authors": "BBC Sport", "category": "sport", "date": "12 hours ago", "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device McGuire stars as Leeds make Grand Final history\n\nHow quickly the mighty can fall.

By winning all four of those aforementioned games.\n\n\"I've said it a few times since I've been at Leeds - all the staff members give you a thumbs up all the time, no matter how bad it gets,\" added McDermott, who has been in charge since 2011.\n\n\"The level of support from everybody at Leeds has been strong this year.

Victory in Slovenia on Sunday would clinch a play-off spot.\n\nThe play-off puzzle\n\nThere's no easy way of explaining this, but here goes...\n\nEight of the nine European runners-up go into a two-legged play off for four places at next year's finals. That means the runner-up with the fewest points misses out.\n\nIt is important to note that results against the bottom side in each group do not count in the final play-off standings.\n\nTherefore Greece, who are sixth, cannot improve their points tally in the final round of games because they play Group H bottom side Gibraltar. They can be overtaken by all three sides below them, including Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe ranking of second-placed teams in the qualifying groups is determined by the highest number of points. If teams are equal on points, positions are decided by goal difference, goals scored, goals scored away from home and fair play points.\n\nFifa says teams will be seeded for the draw on 17 October, with the top four sides according to its rankings at the time in one pot and the remaining four in another.\n\nThe teams currently in second place are Portugal (third in rankings), Wales (13), Italy (17), Croatia (18), Northern Ireland (20), Sweden (23), Denmark (26), Scotland (43) and Greece (47).\n\nWhile there are clearly plenty of permutations, Northern Ireland and/or Wales could be seeded, meaning a play-off against Scotland is a possibility.\n\nPlay-off table as it stands Position/Team Played Goal difference Goals scored Pts 1 Portugal 7 +18 22 18 2 Italy 7 +3 11 14 3 Sweden 7 +10 17 13 4 Denmark 7 +7 12 13 5 Northern Ireland 7 +5 10 13 6 Greece 8 +4 9 13 7 Wales 7 +2 7 11 8 Croatia 7 +2 6 11 9 Scotland 7 -1 8 11\n\nWales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland could join Northern Ireland in securing second place but each of those teams could still potentially be out of luck, as they can all still finish ninth in this table.\n\nRest of Europe - Netherlands set to miss out\n\nEurope's places: 14 including hosts Russia. Already qualified: Belgium, Russia, Germany, England, Spain\n\nThey may be three-times World Cup runners-up but the Netherlands' hopes of reaching next year's tournament are as good as over.\n\nThe Dutch are in third place in Group A, behind France and Sweden, and they need to beat Sweden by an improbable seven goals on Tuesday in order to reach the play-offs.\n\nSurprise Euro 2016 quarter-finalists Iceland, the smallest nation to qualify for a major tournament when they reached Euro 2016, are in pole position to win Group I after a fine win in Turkey on Friday night.\n\nPortugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Group B leaders Switzerland on Tuesday as they aim to make up a three-point deficit.\n\nRoad to Russia: The key dates\n\n17 October: Europe play-off draw (Zurich)\n\nEurope play-off draw (Zurich) 9-11 November: Play-off first legs\n\nPlay-off first legs 12-14 November: Play-off second legs\n\nPlay-off second legs 1 December: Groups are drawn\n\nGroups are drawn 14 June - 15 July 2018: World Cup\n\nAsia - The Syria story\n\nSyria players celebrate after a 2-2 draw with Iran secured a play-off against Australia\n\nAsian places: 4 (plus a play-off place).

Ecuador have lost their previous five qualifying games.\n\nPeru are hosting fourth-placed Colombia and should they draw, Argentina would be eliminated if they did not win.\n\nChile, who are third, go to already-qualified Brazil, while Uruguay, who are all-but assured of their place in Russia because of their vastly superior goal difference, need just a draw at home to already-eliminated Bolivia to guarantee qualification.\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables\n\nConcacaf - Who will join Mexico?\n\nNorth America, Central America and Caribbean places: 3 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Mexico, Costa Rica\n\nMexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer having already qualified from the Concacaf section, with 2014 World Cup quarter-finalists Costa Rica joining them following a 1-1 draw at home to Honduras on Saturday.\n\nBut a third automatic berth is still up for grabs, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs.\n\nOn Friday night, USA beat surprise package Panama 4-0 to move into third and within touching distance of automatic qualification.\n\nThey travel to bottom of the table Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday knowing victory will seal their spot.\n\nPanama now look destined for a play-off match against either Syria or Australia to land a World Cup place for the first time in their history.\n\nHonduras, whose match in Costa Rica was put back a day because of Hurricane Nate, also remain in the mix. They could still seal an automatic berth though it would need them to beat group winners Mexico and for both USA and Panama to lose their final games.\n\nNorth America, Central America and Caribbean World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables\n\nAfrica - Nigeria secure their place\n\nAfrican places: 5. Already qualified: Nigeria\n\nNigeria have secured a sixth World Cup appearance, while Egypt - led by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah - are on course for their first since 1990, but Africa Cup of Nations champions Cameroon are out of the running.\n\nThere are no play-offs in Africa, with the team that top each of the five qualifying groups going through. Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal are the other current group leaders.\n\nAfrican World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables\n\nOceania - New Zealand await opponents\n\nOceania places: One play-off place.

And its quick speed decreased the likelihood of prolonged rain that would tax the city's weakened drainage pump system. Still, the city famous for all-night partying was placed under a curfew, effective at 7 p.m., and the streets were not nearly as crowded as they would be on a typical Saturday night.\n\nCities along the Mississippi coast such as Gulfport and Biloxi were on high alert. Some beachfront hotels and casinos were evacuated. Rain began falling on the region Saturday and forecasters called for 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) with as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) in some isolated places.\n\nNate weakened slightly and was a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 85 mph (137 kph) when it made landfall. Forecasters had said it was possible that it could strengthen to a Category 2, but that seemed less likely as the night wore on.\n\nStorm surge threatened low-lying communities in southeast Louisiana, eastward to the Alabama fishing village of Bayou la Batre.\n\n\"If it floods again, this will be it. I can't live on promises,\" said Larry Bertron as said as he and his wife prepared to leave their home in the Braithwaite community of vulnerable Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane veterans lost one home to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and were leaving the home they rebuilt after Hurricane Isaac in 2012.\n\nGovernors in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama declared states of emergency. The three states have been mostly spared during this hectic hurricane season.\n\n\"This is the worst hurricane that has impacted Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina,\" Mississippi Emergency Management Director Lee Smithson said Saturday. \"Everyone needs to understand that, that this is a significantly dangerous situation.\"\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards urged residents to make final preparations quickly and stressed that Nate will bring the possibility of storm surge reaching up to 11 feet in some coastal areas.\n\n\"It's going to hit and move through our area at a relatively fast rate, limiting the amount of time it's going to drop rain,\" Edwards said. \"But this is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.\"\n\nStreets in low-lying areas of Louisiana were already flooded. Places outside of levee protections were under mandatory evacuation orders and shelters opened there.\n\nSome people worried about New Orleans' pumping system, which had problems during a heavy thunderstorm on Aug. 5. The deluge exposed system weaknesses - including the failure of some pumps and power-generating turbines - and caused homes and businesses to flood. Repairs have been made but the system remained below maximum pumping capacity.\n\nOn Alabama's Dauphin Island, water washed over the road Saturday on the island's low-lying west end, said Mayor Jeff Collier. The storm was projected to bring storm surges from seven to 11 feet near the Alabama-Mississippi state line. Some of the biggest impacts could be at the top of funnel-shaped Mobile Bay.\n\nThe window for preparing \"is quickly closing,\" Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents of the Panhandle to prepare for Nate's impact.\n\n\"Hurricane Nate is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges, strong winds and tornados that could reach across the Panhandle,\" Scott said. The evacuations affect roughly 100,000 residents in the western Panhandle.\n\nThe Pensacola International Airport announced it will close at 6 p.m. Saturday and remain closed on Sunday. However, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was open Saturday.\n\n\"We are urging customers to check with their specific airlines to see whether their flights have been canceled because there have been some of those,\" spokeswoman Michelle Wilcut said.\n\nAt 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, Nate was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The storm is expected to quickly weaken as it cuts a path through the Southeast on its way to the Northeast, which could see impacts from Nate early next week.\n\nNate killed at least 21 people after strafing Central America.\n\nWaterside sections of New Orleans, outside the city's levee system, were under an evacuation order. About 2,000 people were affected. But not everyone was complying.\n\nGabriel Black stayed behind because an 81-year-old neighbor refused to leave.\n\n\"I know it sounds insane, but he has bad legs and he doesn't have anybody who can get to him,\" Black said.\n\nAhead of Saturday night's curfew, some bars were closed in the French Quarter but music blasted from others.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Chandler in Alabama and Kevin McGill in New Orleans, and AP photographer Gerald Herbert in Plaquemines Parish, contributed to this report.", "summary": "Nate was expected to pass to the east of New Orleans, sparing the city its most ferocious winds and storm surge.\nNate weakened slightly and was a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 85 mph (137 kph) when it made landfall.\n\"This is the worst hurricane that has impacted Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina,\" Mississippi Emergency Management Director Lee Smithson said Saturday.\n\"Hurricane Nate is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges, strong winds and tornados that could reach across the Panhandle,\" Scott said.\nAt 8 p.m. EDT Saturday, Nate was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River.", "score": 0}, {"source": "Business Insider", "title": "Trump is hoping Mueller will do the one thing Comey didn't", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mueller-comey-russia-investigation-2017-10", "top_image_url": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/59cac5b98fdbfe1f008b46b4-1190-625/trump-is-hoping-mueller-will-do-the-one-thing-comey-didnt.jpg", "description": "President Donald Trump's lawyers have adopted a...", "authors": "Sonam Sheth", "category": "business", "date": "16 hours ago", "text": "President Donald Trump's lawyers have adopted a new legal strategy of cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller in the hopes that he will do the one thing former FBI director James Comey did not: confirm publicly that Trump is not being investigated as part of the FBI's Russia probe, according to The New York Times.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after Trump fired Comey in May.

The carmaker is on pace to sell 100,000 vehicles in a year for the first time in its 14-year history. But it's also far, far behind with the production of its new Model 3 sedan, the vehicle that's supposed to bring Tesla to the masses and spell the beginning of the end for gas-powered cars. Tesla said that it would produce 1,500 Model 3s in September; it has managed fewer than 300 since the car was launched in July. Getting to 20,000 in monthly production by December now seems like a hopeless expectation, as does CEO Elon Musk's prediction that Tesla will be manufacturing 500,000 vehicles annually by the end of 2018. This means that the half-million pre-orders for the Model 3 could go unfulfilled for several years, putting a huge number of $1,000 refundable deposits for each new car in doubt. That threat is real, but the markets are unconcerned. Tesla stock is still up 65% in 2017 and the brand has lost none of its captivating aura. But it's also obvious that for a carmaker that's been around as long as Tesla shouldbe good at, Tesla isn't: building vehicles. So why is Tesla struggling to build the Model 3 on its own admittedly ambitious schedule? There are five main reasons: View As: One Page Slides\n\n1. The numbers don't mean anything. Tesla has a long history of overpromising and underdelivering. Customers and investors have been more than happy to forgive the automaker for this transgression, largely because both groups understand that there's nothing to be gained if Tesla under promises and over delivers. Tesla does not benefit from being normal. The company's entire DNA is organized around being special, different, extraordinary. Leave it to the General Motors' of the world to announce an all-electric Tesla Model 3 competitor, the Chevy Bolt, in 2015 and have it hit the streets by 2016. Tesla's game is to astound (eventually), not execute. As such, the only predictions that matter are outsized ones. You don't change the world by restraining yourself. And Wall Street doesn't care. Over the past two years, Tesla's stock has been wildly volatile. But it's still up over 1,200% since the company's 2010 IPO. Despite almost no profitable quarters and a balance sheet that can keep the company in business for only about a year before the cash is all gone.\n\n2. The Model 3 is all-new production. Tesla is reasonably good at manufacturing its expensive, luxurious Model S sedans and Model X SUV. Production of these vehicles was designed around a run-rate of about 100,000 per year, and Tesla will hit that mark most likely in 2017. Of course, the Model X endured \"production hell,\" as Musk memorably put it, during its roll-out in 2016. The Model S also endured early production issues that were later corrected. And Musk declared that production hell would be back for the Model 3. In fact, production hell often seems to be Tesla's default state. Traditional automakers are quite good at mass production, but Tesla has not been challenged to be a mass-production company until now. Musk talks about Model 3 production in terms of an \"S curve,\" with a very slow ramp rapidly speeding up before leveling off at a desired point. But Tesla also has a second S curve, related to learning. It doesn't know, exactly, how to build the Model 3. The company also skipped a beta-stage of production, in order to launch the Model 3 ahead of schedule this year. And although the Model 3, according to Musk, was engineered for rapid production, it's still a new thing. Established automakers build cheaper cars in volume all the time; Tesla never has.\n\n3. Tesla enjoys endless patience from everybody. Tesla's brand equity is probably its most valuable asset. Short-sellers aren't fans, and plenty of analysts argue that Musk is all hat and no cattle, but everybody else loves the company. And Tesla knows it. Having built up massive positive brand equity over the years, Tesla has the advantage of \"spending\" it from time to time by, frankly, deceiving the public. Within this negative pact, however, is shared understanding: Yes, we aren't going to make our goals \u2014 but we also aren't going to lose focus on the big picture, which isn't to sell more cars, but rather to save the planet. Unlike most other companies, even professedly do-gooding outfits in Silicon Valley, Tesla truly has a mission, one that's difficult to resist or criticize. Importantly, Tesla has earned this trust by delivering a genuine payoff to anybody who's willing to go along for the ride.\n\n4. Tesla isn't actually mass-producing the Model 3 yet. A lot of things have to happen at the right time even for an inexpensive, simple-to-build vehicle to stay on schedule. In 2011, when a tsunami and nuclear-plant disaster hit Japan, the automotive supply chain was massively disrupted for Toyota and Honda, leading to manufacturing slowdowns worldwide. Tesla is still small by the standards of the auto industry. The company's California factory is also off the grid a bit, as the US car business runs out of the Midwest and the South. Tesla has only recently gained access, according to the company, to the best teams at the best suppliers, and the history of its manufacturing is one of fits and starts. The Model X, for example, went through both a rear-door and rear-seat redesign just months before the car launched in 2015. Even if Tesla had hit its goal of 1,500 Model 3s in September, it would still be a long way from the levels of production needed to meet demand. The low numbers, which the company chalked up to production \"bottlenecks,\" suggest that the ramp to just pre-mass-production is taking longer than expected. If Tesla hadn't fallen so short of its own run-rate for September, we could assume some bobbles, but unfortunately, it looks more like the decision to forego the process of testing out the Model 3 assembly line before trying to accelerate the production ramp isn't working out.", "summary": "But it's also obvious that for a carmaker that's been around as long as Tesla shouldbe good at, Tesla isn't: building vehicles.\nSo why is Tesla struggling to build the Model 3 on its own admittedly ambitious schedule?\nLeave it to the General Motors' of the world to announce an all-electric Tesla Model 3 competitor, the Chevy Bolt, in 2015 and have it hit the streets by 2016.\nTesla is reasonably good at manufacturing its expensive, luxurious Model S sedans and Model X SUV.\nTesla isn't actually mass-producing the Model 3 yet.", "score": 0}, {"source": "Business Insider", "title": "Trump defends throwing 'beautiful, soft' paper towel rolls into crowd of hurricane victims in Puerto Rico", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defends-paper-towel-toss-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-victims-2017-10", "top_image_url": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/59d3f97d351ccf0b078b5adf-1190-625/trump-defends-throwing-beautiful-soft-paper-towel-rolls-into-crowd-of-hurricane-victims-in-puerto-rico.jpg", "description": "President Donald Trump in an interview...", "authors": "Michelle Mark", "category": "business", "date": "21 hours ago", "text": "President Donald Trump in an interview broadcast on Saturday defended his decision to throw rolls of paper towels into a crowd filled with people affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.\n\nHe told former Arkansas Gov.

One of the ways it is doing this is by rolling out a series of new features designed to improve their experience \u2014 and in some cases, their earnings \u2014 as Uber\u2019s massive workforce.\n\nIts rival Lyft, which has spent the better part of the year quietly taking advantage of Uber\u2019s misfortunes, has followed suit, matching many of Uber\u2019s newer features in lockstep.\n\nOne simple example: Over the past several months, both Uber and Lyft have launched 24/7 phone support for drivers, who may have issues with a passenger or payment.\n\nAnother, more complex: This past August, Uber increased the number of times that drivers can choose which locations they want to drive toward \u2014 while picking up rides along the way \u2014 to six per day, up from two. Lyft also made this change \u2014 which drivers can use to head toward home at the end of a shift, for example \u2014 but Uber has since rolled it back to two times per day. The company, which is looking for a better solution, saw that drivers in some markets were using the feature enough that there were fewer drivers along some routes, leading to longer wait times.\n\nLyft and Uber are racing to add driver-friendly features Feature What it means When Lyft launched When Uber launched Feature What it means When Lyft launched When Uber launched Tipping Riders have the option to tip drivers at the end of the trip. 2012 Jun. 2017 Instant payout Drivers can cash out their earnings instantly. No minimum for Uber; $50 minimum for Lyft. Oct. 2015 Mar. 2016 24/7 phone support Drivers can reach a customer support agent at all times. Lyft also offers Spanish phone support. Sep. 2017 Jul. 2017 Paid wait time Uber drivers are paid for every minute they wait for a rider after a 2-minute grace period. - Jun. 2017 Cancellation fee after 2 minutes Uber riders are charged $5 if they cancel a ride more than 2 minutes after being assigned a driver. It's after 5 minutes on Lyft. - Jun. 2017 Optional driver injury protection Those who opt in pay 3.75 cents for every mile there is a passenger in the car. - Jun. 2017 Payment for returning lost items Drivers are paid for returning things that riders left in their car. - Jul. 2017 Driver-set destinations Drivers can choose the locations they want to drive toward \u2014 picking up passengers along the way \u2014 up to six times per day.

Jun. 2017 Jul. 2015 Driver operations centers Locations where drivers can speak to someone in person about any questions or concerns. Lyft has 18 Uber has 200 in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant shift for drivers, many of whom \u2014 despite the improvements on both platforms \u2014 continue to bemoan their low earnings. But for the first time, Uber and Lyft are competing for drivers by creating features that actually appeal in a real way.\n\nPrior to this year, Uber and Lyft\u2019s competition for drivers in part boiled down to a price war. As the companies grew across the U.S., many \u2014 including some professional drivers \u2014 flocked to the services for promises of a new and convenient source of income.\n\nPart of that meant Uber and Lyft had to offer things like driver guarantees and other promotions to attract these drivers. They also aggressively competed on pricing to attract more riders. Remember, it\u2019s a network business: More riders means more drivers, which is better for both parties.\n\nHowever, now that Lyft has expanded across the U.S. and Uber has reached the massive scale that it has, finding new drivers has become difficult. As a result, driver retention \u2014 not acquisition \u2014 has become a real priority for the companies\u2019 respective businesses. That\u2019s become more true now that Uber took a hit to its market share following its series of unfortunate events of 2017 and the multiple #deleteUber campaigns that turned off thousands of riders.\n\nLyft has long held the title of the \u201cdriver friendly\u201d ride-hail app in the U.S., thanks mostly to one major distinction for drivers: Tipping.\n\nOver the years, Lyft rolled out features like an instant cash-out option for drivers called Express Pay, and Uber followed suit months later. But there was not one clear, sustained difference other than the option to tip drivers. (Uber\u2019s former CEO Travis Kalanick was a steadfast opponent of adding a tipping option, for fear of adding friction to the rider experience.)\n\nBut now Uber has rolled out tipping, paid wait times, 24-hour customer service, and a bonus fee for each UberPool customer that a driver picks up. Lyft has matched many of these features. And it\u2019s become harder to discern which company is truly the most \u201cdriver friendly.\u201d\n\nIt really comes down to the question of trust: Do drivers believe that either Uber or Lyft actually care about them? Will they ever? And how will that affect driver retention over the long run?", "summary": "Lyft and Uber are racing to add driver-friendly features Feature What it means When Lyft launched When Uber launched Feature What it means When Lyft launched When Uber launched Tipping Riders have the option to tip drivers at the end of the trip.\n2017 Paid wait time Uber drivers are paid for every minute they wait for a rider after a 2-minute grace period.\nBut for the first time, Uber and Lyft are competing for drivers by creating features that actually appeal in a real way.\nPart of that meant Uber and Lyft had to offer things like driver guarantees and other promotions to attract these drivers.\nOver the years, Lyft rolled out features like an instant cash-out option for drivers called Express Pay, and Uber followed suit months later.", "score": 0}, {"source": "Recode", "title": "AOL\u2019s instant messenger service still has (had) an audience of 500,000 a month", "url": "https://www.recode.net/2017/10/6/16439106/aol-instant-messenger-aim-shutting-down-unique-visitors", "top_image_url": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z4Ib0buhxgjP57yMy5wwgt-ycbQ=/0x0:2228x1298/fit-in/1200x630/filters:fill(ffffff)/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9409321/Screen_Shot_2017_10_06_at_4.51.38_PM.png", "description": "It never really made it on mobile.", "authors": "Rani Molla", "category": "technology", "date": "14 hours ago", "text": "AIM, AOL\u2019s iconic instant messenger service, is shutting down after 20 years.\n\nWhile it might feel like it\u2019s from another era, as of August AIM had about 500,000 unique visitors in the U.S., according to data from measurement company comScore.

The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly \u2014 and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller\u2019s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.\n\nDonald F.

She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.\n\n\u201cMueller\u2019s not going to make a statement,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s not going to want to claw it back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.\n\nMr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to help Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.\n\nBut White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.\n\nOne sign of the White House\u2019s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.\n\nEven as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.\n\nBut lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.\n\nThe White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee\u2019s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.\n\nThat report could be finished before Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.

But Mr. Weinstein\u2019s leave \u2014 not to mention an internal investigation and a board in disarray \u2014 may also curb those efforts, which include two major series in the works for Amazon Studios and three planned for Viacom\u2019s new Paramount channel.\n\nIn response to the news of the sexual harassment allegations, at least four Democratic senators said on Thursday that they would give away donations they had received from Mr. Weinstein, a supporter of several progressive causes. They were joined on Friday by Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nSome celebrities also reacted to the news, expressing frustration with the behavior described in the report while voicing support for the women who chose to speak out publicly.\n\nBut several actors, producers and directors contacted on Friday declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein and the relatively minimal public conversation in Hollywood about his behavior.

Pisthiwan Salahi, said Mr. Mohemin was not only an Islamic State soldier but also a member of an elite suicide squad known as the Seekers of Martyrdom, according to informers. If convicted of that affiliation by an Asayish court, his sentence would be long; if he was connected to any killings, possibly lifelong.\n\nMr. Mohemin\u2019s narrative differed. \u201cI was just a common soldier,\u201d he said. \u201cI never killed a civilian.

He praised his beribboned guests as the \u201cworld\u2019s great military people\u201d and excused the stymied reporters, who returned to their workstations to start another round of: What was the president talking about?\n\nBy Friday, the White House was still unable to shed light on the matter; several of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said they had no idea what the president meant. But the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, wanted to make one thing clear: Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t just teasing his favorite antagonists. He was sending a message.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that he\u2019s messing with the press,\u201d Ms. Sanders told reporters. \u201cI think we have some serious world issues here. I think that North Korea, Iran both continue to be bad actors, and the president is somebody who\u2019s going to always look for ways to protect Americans, and he\u2019s not going to dictate what those actions may look like.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Mr. Trump\u2019s preprandial banter took on an ominous tone. Maybe he was foreshadowing war with North Korea, which he has already threatened with \u201cfire and fury\u201d if the reclusive country aimed its missiles at the United States. Or perhaps he was predicting a clash with Iran, a week before he is expected to disavow the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to lay out his game plan for our enemies,\u201d Ms. Sanders declared.\n\nSometimes, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements leave his own staff in the dark, forcing them to impute a meaning to his words that might not actually exist. Privately, a few aides said they did not believe the president was preparing the country for war with either North Korea or Iran.\n\nBut they also noted Ms. Sanders has had a more successful debut as press secretary than her predecessor, Sean Spicer, in part because she has not attempted to clean up Mr. Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 something that would rankle the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d The Justice Department later said there was no evidence that Mr. Obama tapped his apartment during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPressed by reporters at the time, Mr. Spicer tried to walk back the claim, saying \u201cthe president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also shows an obvious delight in keeping people guessing. At the United Nations last month, he announced he had made up his mind about how to handle the Iran nuclear deal, but was not going to tell the public. When he met Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, perhaps America\u2019s closest ally, she asked him what he had decided. He refused to tell her, either.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say today he\u2019s made a decision,\u201d a bemused Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said at the time. \u201cI knew he had, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to say he had.\u201d\n\nHenry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is credited with coining the principle of constructive ambiguity in diplomacy: the use of deliberately fuzzy language to overcome sensitive issues in negotiations between countries. Mr. Trump may have tried a variation of that on Thursday evening, except that he was applying it to military deterrence.\n\nIn his prepared remarks to the military leaders, Mr. Trump outlined a series of specific challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have had challenges that we really should have taken care of a long time ago, like North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, ISIS and the revisionist powers that threaten our interests all around the world,\u201d the president said, using the an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nWhat made Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d particularly tantalizing was the timing.\n\nFor weeks, he has promised to retaliate against any North Korean aggression toward the United States. When Mr. Tillerson spoke in Beijing last week about seeking diplomatic channels to the North, Mr. Trump followed up with a tweet that his chief diplomat was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d the president\u2019s nickname for the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.\n\nMr. Trump also faces an Oct. 15 deadline to recertify the nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated among world powers during the Obama administration. He is expected to decline to recertify the agreement, which would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it is equally plausible that Mr. Trump was merely being theatrical, using the backdrop of military officers to stir up some drama. As the president spoke, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Paul J. Selva, stood next to him stoically.\n\nPerhaps it is not Mr. Kissinger, but his former boss, Richard M. Nixon, who is the president\u2019s model. Nixon devised the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of statecraft, under which he hoped to keep the nation\u2019s foes off balance by persuading them that he was impulsive and unpredictable.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Trump had adopted Nixon\u2019s keep-\u2018em-guessing approach, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, is the president trying to do that? Absolutely. I mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Trump, he seemed to savor the speculation. When a reporter asked him during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office what he meant by the \u201ccalm before the storm,\u201d he winked, paused, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d", "summary": "As the generals shifted from foot to foot, Mr. Trump brought the game of 20 Questions to an end.\nMr. Trump may have tried a variation of that on Thursday evening, except that he was applying it to military deterrence.\nWhat made Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d particularly tantalizing was the timing.\nAsked whether Mr. Trump had adopted Nixon\u2019s keep-\u2018em-guessing approach, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, is the president trying to do that?\nI mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump, he seemed to savor the speculation.", "score": -10}, {"source": "Newsweek", "title": "Richard Spencer brought his white nationalist crew back to Charlottesville in the dark of night", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/neo-nazi-cowards-return-charlottesville-torches-stage-white-nationalist-680196", "top_image_url": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/10/07/gettyimages-830755846.jpg", "description": "The same tiki torches\u2014and the same white men\u2014returned to Charlottesville Saturday night.", "authors": "Michael Edison Hayden", "category": "general", "date": "4 hours ago", "text": "Less than two months have passed since a white nationalist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, collapsed into violence, leading to the death of activist Heather Heyer.

Once again, the men held tiki torches up in the college town, protesting the city\u2019s planned removal of the Lee statue\u2014scheduled for the better part of a year now.

In one video posted on Gab, a speaker announced into a bullhorn that people would have to \"get used\" to the alt-right movement, and then the group broke into an impromptu, off-key sing-a-long of \"Dixie,\" a 19th century song that emerged from the tradition of blackface minstelry.\n\nCharlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Spencer\u2019s protest movement, spoke out against the gathering on Twitter, and suggested that the city is examining potential legal options to limit gatherings like the one staged by Spencer tonight.\n\nAnother despicable visit by neo-Nazi cowards.

She said that Weinstein invited her to a business meeting in a hotel room and made several requests of her, including that she watch him shower.\n\nWeinstein told The Wrap Thursday that he intended to sue to the Times, and Lisa Bloom, a lawyer acting as his adviser, stated that \u201che denies many of the accusations as patently false.\u201d Weinstein has taken an indefinite leave of absence from the production company and issued a statement that said he had \u201c brought on therapists... to deal with this issue head-on.\u201d Bloom resigned as his adviser on Saturday.\n\nMcCord, who has spoken about her own rape at the age of 18 by someone she knew, said that fear of losing jobs can make women vulnerable in an industry where people with money so often hold the most power, and where decisions, particularly on casting, can be so subjective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an everyday occasion as far as I\u2019m concerned. I do know many colleagues, I know many people who have experienced things, who would never say them to this day.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a hard no, but the pressure is immense.

The paper has called on the producer to release the women from the non-disclosure agreements and allow them to speak without fear of reprisal.\n\nOn the subject of whether people in the industry who have suffered sexual harassment should go public, McCord refers to her own experience of talking about her sexual abuse several years after it had happened. \u201cThere is no should.

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nHow Did it Come About?\n\nCongressional committees have been keen to discover the answer to that very question. Delivering an update on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation Wednesday, Chairman Richard Burr said the panel \u201ccannot decide the credibility\u201d of the dossier without first knowing its sources and financers. Various reports, however, have been consistent that the dossier was first paid for by anti-Trump Republicans and then Democrats took over its financing as the 2016 election campaign progressed.\n\nWho Compiled it?\n\nThe U.S.-based research firm Fusion GPS hired Steele, a former MI6 spy, to compile the dossier. During his stint with the British intelligence agency, Steele spent time working under diplomatic cover in Moscow toward the end of the Cold War. He was said by British news reports to be a Russian expert who worked on the high-profile investigation into the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London. After leaving MI6 in 2009, Steele founded a London-based private intelligence firm. Intelligence historian Nigel West, who worked with Steele, described him as \u201cJames Bond.\u201d\n\nRon Sachs - Pool/Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Dossier?\n\nThe 35-page dossier is a collection of memos concerning Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election and claims that the country has been supporting Trump for at least five years. While it notes that Trump had rejected several Russian business deals proposed in order to curry favor with the then-presidential candidate, it says his campaign did accept information on his opponents. More specifically, it alleges contact between Russian officials and a member of the Trump campaign, notably that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen helped facilitate the arrangements.\n\nWhat caught most people\u2019s eyes when the dossier was published by Buzzfeed News in January, though, were the more salacious allegations. Although Steele\u2019s findings assert that Russia attempted to collect compromising material on both Trump and his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, the Kremlin is said to have been far more successful in its attempts regarding the Republican candidate. Indeed, the dossier claims that the Russian FSB spy agency possesses a video of Trump successfully requesting prostitutes to urinate on a bed while staying in a Moscow hotel room once occupied by the former president and first lady, Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nIs it True?\n\nThere have certainly been plenty of vehement denials. Trump has on multiple occasions ridiculed both the dossier\u2019s findings and its author, who the president called a \u201cfailed spy.\u201d Cohen sent a letter to Congress in August strongly denying the allegations made against him, although he did not mention the personal claims made against the president. And this week three Russians named in the dossier filed a lawsuit in Washington claiming their reputations had been ruined by the claims.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that investigators are taking the dossier far more seriously than was initially believed. Although the particular claim that saw the report nicknamed the \u201cgolden shower,\" or \u201cpee tape,\u201d dossier has not been verified, the intelligence community has corroborated the broad assertion about Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in the election, CNN has reported. Officials have also agreed that the communication between non-Americans contained in the report did in fact take place. What Trump has called \u201cfake news\u201d would appear to be, at least in part, far more real.", "summary": "Indeed, the investigation into the document compiled by a former British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele, has only increased in scale.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowHow Did it Come About?\nThe U.S.-based research firm Fusion GPS hired Steele, a former MI6 spy, to compile the dossier.\nIntelligence historian Nigel West, who worked with Steele, described him as \u201cJames Bond.\u201dRon Sachs - Pool/Getty ImagesWhat\u2019s in the Dossier?\nWhat caught most people\u2019s eyes when the dossier was published by Buzzfeed News in January, though, were the more salacious allegations.", "score": -10}, {"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "Facebook security chief rants about misguided \u201calgorithm\u201d backlash", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/07/alex-stamos/", "top_image_url": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/facebook-alex-stamos.png", "description": "\"I am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech cos\" wrote Facebook..", "authors": "Josh Constine", "category": "technology", "date": "12 hours ago", "text": "\u201cI am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech cos\u201d wrote Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos on Saturday in a reeling tweetstorm.

Nobody is not aware of the risks. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nYet this argument minimizes many of Facebook\u2019s troubles. The issue isn\u2019t that Facebook doesn\u2019t know algorithms can be biased or that people don\u2019t know these are tough problems, but that the company didn\u2019t anticipate abuses of the platform and work harder to build algorithms or human moderation processes that could block fake news and fraudulent ad buys before they impacted the 2016 U.S. presidential election, instead of now. And his tweetstorm completely glosses over the fact that Facebook will fire employees that talk to the press without authorization.\n\n[Update: 3:30pm PT) I commend Stamos for speaking so candidly to the public about an issue where more transparency is appreciated. But simultaneously, Facebook holds the information and context he says journalists and by extension the public lack, and the company is free to bring in reporters for the necessary briefings. I\u2019d certainly attend a \u201cWhiteboard\u201d session like Facebook has often held for reporters in the past on topics like News Feed sorting or privacy controls.]\n\nStamos\u2019 comments hold weight because he\u2019s leading Facebook\u2019s investigation into Russian election tampering. He was the Chief Information Security Officer as Yahoo before taking the CSO role at Facebook in mid-2015.\n\nThe sprawling response to recent backlash comes right as Facebook starts making the changes it should have implemented before the election. Today, Axios reports that Facebook just emailed advertisers to inform them that ads targeted by \u201cpolitics, religion, ethnicity or social issues\u201d will have to be manually approved before they\u2019re sold and distributed.\n\nAnd yesterday, Facebook updated an October 2nd blog post about disclosing Russian-bought election interference ads to congress to note that \u201cOf the more than 3,000 ads that we have shared with Congress, 5% appeared on Instagram. About $6,700 was spent on these ads\u201d, implicating Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing acquisition in the scandal for the first time.\n\nStamos\u2019 tweetstorm was set off by Lawfare associate editor and Washington Post contributor Quinta Jurecic, who commented that Facebook\u2019s shift towards human editors implies that saying \u201cthe algorithm is bad now, we\u2019re going to have people do this\u201d actually \u201cjust entrenches The Algorithm as a mythic entity beyond understanding rather than something that was designed poorly and irresponsibly and which could have been designed better.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s my tweet-by-tweet interpretation of Stamos\u2019 perspective:\n\nI appreciate Quinta's work (especially on Rational Security) but this thread demonstrates a real gap between academics/journalists and SV. https://t.co/CWulZrFaso \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nHe starts by saying journalists and academics don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like to actually like to implement solutions to hard problems, yet clearly no one has the right answers yet.\n\nI am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech cos. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nFacebook\u2019s team has supposedly been pigeonholed as naive of real-life consequences or too technical to see the human impact of its platform, but the outcomes speak for themselves about the team\u2019s inadequacy to proactively protect against election abuse.\n\nNobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral. Nobody is not aware of the risks. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nFacebook gets that people code their biases into algorithms, and works to stop that. But censorship that results from overzealous algorithms hasn\u2019t been the real problem. Algorithmic negligence of worst-case scenarios for malicious usage of Facebook products is.\n\nIn fact, an understanding of the risks of machine learning (ML) drives small-c conservatism in solving some issues. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nUnderstanding of the risks of algorithms is what\u2019s kept Facebook from over-aggressively implementing them in ways that could have led to censorship, which is responsible but doesn\u2019t solve the urgent problem of abuse at hand.\n\nFor example, lots of journalists have celebrated academics who have made wild claims of how easy it is to spot fake news and propaganda. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nNow Facebook\u2019s CSO is calling journalists\u2019 demands for better algorithms fake news, because these algorithms are hard to build without becoming a dragnet that attacks innocent content too.\n\nWithout considering the downside of training ML systems to classify something as fake based upon ideologically biased training data. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nWhat is totally false might be somewhat easy to spot, but the polarizing, exaggerated, opinionated content many see as \u201cfake\u201d is tough to train AI to spot because of the nuance with which it\u2019s separated from legitimate news, which is a valid point.\n\nA bunch of the public research really comes down to the feedback loop of \"we believe this viewpoint is being pushed by bots\" -> ML \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nStamos says it\u2019s not as simple as fighting bots with algorithms because\u2026\n\nSo if you don't worry about becoming the Ministry of Truth with ML systems trained on your personal biases, then it's easy! \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\n\u2026Facebok would end up becoming the truth police. That might lead to criticism from conservatives if their content is targeted for removal, which is why Facebook outsourced fact-checking to third-party organizations and reportedly delayed News Feed changes to address clickbait before the election.\n\nLikewise all the stories about \"The Algorithm\". In any situation where millions/billions/tens of Bs of items need to be sorted, need algos \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nEven though Facebook prints money, some datasets are still too big to hire enough people to review manually, so Stamos believes algorithms are an unavoidable tool.\n\nMy suggestion for journalists is to try to talk to people who have actually had to solve these problems and live with the consequences. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nSure, journalists should do more of their homework, but Facebook employees or those at other tech companies can be fired for discussing work with reporters if they don\u2019t have PR approval.\n\nAnd to be careful of their own biases when making leaps of judgment between facts. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s true that as journalists seek to fight for the public good, they may overstep the bounds of their knowledge. Though Facebook\u2019s best strategy here is likely being more thick-skinned to criticism while making progress on the necessary work rather than complaining about the company\u2019s treatment.\n\nIf your piece ties together bad guys abusing platforms, algorithms and the Manifestbro into one grand theory of SV, then you might be biased \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nJournalists do sometimes tie everything up in a neat bow when they\u2019re really messier, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not at the start of a cultural shift about platform responsibility in Silicon Valley.\n\nIf your piece assumes that a problem hasn't been addressed because everybody at these companies is a nerd, you are incorrect. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nStamos says it\u2019s not a lack of empathy or understanding of the non-engineering elements to blame, though Facebook\u2019s idealistic leadership did certainly fail to anticipate how significantly its products could be abused to interfere with elections, hence all the reactive changes happening now.\n\nIf you call for less speech by the people you dislike but also complain when the people you like are censored, be careful. Really common. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nAnother fair point, as we often want aggressive protection against views we disagree with while fearing censorship of our own perspective when those things go hand in hand. But no one is calling for Facebook to be haphazard with the creation of these algorithms. We\u2019re just saying it\u2019s an urgent problem.\n\nIf you call for some type of speech to be controlled, then think long and hard of how those rules/systems can be abused both here and abroad \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nThis is true, but so is the inverse. Facebook neded to think long and hard about how its systems could be abused if speech wasn\u2019t controlled in any way and fake news or ads were used to sway elections. Giving everyone a voice is a double-edged sword.\n\nLikewise if your call for data to be protected from governments is based upon who the person being protected is. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nYes, people should take a wholistic view of free speech and censorship, knowing both must fairly cross both sides of the aisle to have a coherent and enforceable policy.\n\nA lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking SV to build. When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nThis is a highly dramatic way of saying be careful what you wish for, as censorship of those you disagree with could bloat into censorship of those you support. But this actually positions Facebook as \u201cthe gods\u201d. Yes, we want better protection, but no, that doesn\u2019t mean we want overly aggressive censorship. It\u2019s on Facebook, the platform owner, to strike this balance.\n\nAnyway, just a Saturday morning thought on how we can better discuss this. Off to Home Depot. FIN \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nNot sure if this was menat to lighten the mood, but it made it sound like his whole tweetstorm was flippantly produced on a whim, which seems like an odd way for the world\u2019s largest social network to discuss its most pressing scandal ever.\n\nOverall, everyone needs to approach this discussion with more nuance. The public should know these are tough problems with potential unintended consequences for rash moves, and that Facebook is aware of the gravity now. Facebook employees should know that the public wants progress urgently, and while it might not understand all the complexities and sometimes makes its criticism personal, it\u2019s still warranted to call for improvement.", "summary": "\u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017Yet this argument minimizes many of Facebook\u2019s troubles.\nHe was the Chief Information Security Officer as Yahoo before taking the CSO role at Facebook in mid-2015.\nThe sprawling response to recent backlash comes right as Facebook starts making the changes it should have implemented before the election.\n\u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017Facebook gets that people code their biases into algorithms, and works to stop that.\n\u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\u2026Facebok would end up becoming the truth police.", "score": -10}, {"source": "Independent", "title": "Donald Trump is on track to win reelection", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-reelection-2020-republican-candidate-latest-a7988676.html", "top_image_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/08/09/tryu.jpg", "description": "More than half of Americans don't think Donald Trump is fit to serve as president, yet he has a clear path to winning reelection.

If Trump isn't removed from office and doesn't lead the country into some form of global catastrophe, he could secure a second term simply by maintaining his current level of support with his political base.\n\nWe have entered a new era in American politics. The 2016 election exposed how economic, social and cultural issues have splintered the country and increasingly divided voters by age, race, education and geography. This isn't going to change.\n\nWhat have changed are the political fault lines that have driven the debate since the early 1980s. Until now, the ideological divides between the parties were largely differences around social issues, defense spending and trade, as well as tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. Today, the central issue has become populism as voters have moved away from the two political parties and increasingly self-identified as independents.\n\nIn 2016, Trump capitalised on this changing political environment. He consolidated the growing number of angry voters who felt let down by the people and institutions controlling power in the country. Trump's support from these voters is personal, not ideological. That explains their willingness to stick with him despite his failures of leadership.\n\nSince Trump's inaugural address, his focus has been on maintaining his support among this loyal base rather than expanding it. As counterintuitive as it may seem, this could be a winning political strategy.\n\nFirst, Trump knows that gaining the support of a majority of voters in a presidential election is not a requirement; it's simply an aspiration. In fact, two out of the last three presidents were elected despite losing the popular vote.\n\nSecond, the continued decline in support for both political parties works to Trump's advantage. The lack of voters' faith in both parties increases the probability that there will be a major third-party candidate on the 2020 ballot. It will also lead to other minor-party candidates joining the presidential race. The multi-candidate field will further divide the anti-Trump vote, making it possible for him to get reelected simply by holding on to his current level of support.\n\nThird, despite dismal poll numbers, Trump enters the contest with a job approval rating that is certainly at least marginally better than what the current national polls would suggest. Throughout the 2016 election, most analysts tracked the national polling, which failed to capture Trump's strength in key battleground states. Current surveys continue to understate his support. Many national polls survey all eligible voters, rather than registered or likely voters, which can underestimate Trump, and some voters may be reluctant to admit that they are pro-Trump at all. Add to that the fact that Trump effectively demonstrated during the 2016 campaign that he is capable of expanding his support by effectively demonising his opponents.\n\nDonald Trump's least presidential moments so far...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 show all Donald Trump's least presidential moments so far...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/17 Defending Russian President Vladimir Putin Donald Trump appeared to equate US foreign actions to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, \u201cThere are a lot of killers.

He doesn\u2019t quite understand, I don\u2019t think, everything that involves in our lives all the time here on the dairy farm.\u201d\n\nCoburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism Chuck Ripp troubleshoots a machine in the milking parlor at his farm, Ripp's Dairy Valley, in Dane, Wisconsin, Sept. 12, 2017. He says he works long hours at the farm, which he co-owns with his brothers Gary and Troy. The dairy relies heavily on Latino workers.\n\nThe farmers\u2019 interest in immigration issues marks a shift. A generation ago, Wisconsin\u2019s agricultural landscape was dominated by small and medium-sized dairy farms run by the families that owned them, and immigration wasn\u2019t a top-line issue for dairy farmers.\n\nBut today, the nation\u2019s No. 2 milk-producing state is home to a growing number of large, concentrated animal-feeding operations. These businesses, which operate 24/7, year-round, require work that some farmers insist most Americans will not do. The number of workers on dairies in Wisconsin has nearly doubled since 2006 to about 14,000, according to federal figures.\n\nHuffPost is hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears \u2015 and what it means to be American today.\n\nAs dairies\u2019 need for workers has grown, the move away from small family farms has dried up the pipeline that once supplied those workers, says Shelly Mayer, executive director for Professional Dairy Producers of Wisconsin, the trade group that hosted the event at Ripp\u2019s Dairy. Rural areas in Wisconsin and across the nation have been losing population. Between 2000 and 2010, Wisconsin\u2019s population grew by 6 percent, but more than a quarter of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties lost population.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just short of people,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cImmigration is... really a symptom of a rural labor shortage. I don\u2019t think any of the farmers are trying to work around the system. They just need a person they can rely on to care for cows.\u201d\n\nCoburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism Sergio Rivera cares for the calves at Ripp's Dairy Valley farm. Rivera is from Mexico and has been working at the farm since 2003. His wife and daughter live with him on the farm. \u201cHere there is more opportunities for work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Mexico, nada.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019d rather have a Latino\u2019\n\nTim Keller, who milks 330 cows on his 600-acre farm near Mount Horeb, about 25 miles west of Madison, has another theory about the importance of immigrant labor to dairy operations: Immigrants work harder.\n\n\u201cEven if an American guy came up right now, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d hire him,\u201d said Keller, who employs five immigrant workers. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a Latino.\u201d\n\nBefore Chuck Ripp\u2019s farm started to grow, he and his brothers hired local high school students to help on the farm. But they never lasted. Now, 11 of the 12 non-family members who work there are Latino immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe cannot find the American person to come in and work full-time on a dairy,\u201d Ripp said. \u201cIt\u2019s too many long hours. It\u2019s too hard of work. And it\u2019s seven days a week, 365 on a dairy farm... A cow does not take a day off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run ads in the papers, looking for milking technicians or people to help milk cows and things like that,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t even get a bite. We don\u2019t even get calls.\u201d\n\nMore than half of all dairy workers in the U.S. are immigrants, according to a 2015 industry-sponsored study, and farms that employ immigrant labor produce 79 percent of the nation\u2019s milk. Dairy farmers have become accustomed to cheap, flexible labor, said Jill Lindsey Harrison, a former University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty member who has studied the rise in immigrant dairy workers in Wisconsin. But at 3.2 percent, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate is near a record low, and some businesses complain they cannot find enough workers to fill positions.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason some farmers may turn to immigrant labor: Immigrants are willing to work long hours under \u201cpretty crummy\u201d conditions to support themselves and their families, explained Harrison, who now teaches at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wisconsin farmers have said it is nearly impossible to convince Americans to take the jobs, which entail cleaning out stalls, covering night, weekend and holiday shifts, and working in every type of weather, including rain, snow, blazing heat and subzero temperatures.\n\nImmigrant workers who do not have legal status are easier to manage because \u201cthey\u2019re going to not ruffle any feathers,\u201d Harrison said. They are generally \u201cafraid to speak up for themselves and demand better jobs.\u201d\n\nWhat if farmers just paid more?\n\nCourtesy of Robert Allen/AFSCME Neil Rainford, a longtime labor activist, believes that more people would be willing to work on dairy farms if the wages were higher.\n\nNeil Rainford, a longtime labor activist who has negotiated wages for employees in workplaces including a municipal sewer plant, a jail and an aluminum manufacturing facility, doesn\u2019t buy the argument that Americans will not clean out barns or get up before dawn to milk cows.\n\nThe other fields Rainford has organized are \u201ceasily as dirty, dangerous and hard as dairy work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all those communities, it was a matter of what wages needed to be paid to get people to do onerous jobs that most people don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe labor market for the dairy industry in Wisconsin is the same as any other labor market,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf demand outstrips supply, then the price \u2014 of labor, in this case \u2014 must increase to meet demand.\u201d\n\nRelying on immigrant labor drives down wages to \u201cunnaturally low\u201d levels for dairy work, meaning U.S. citizens cannot get jobs with family-supporting income in their home communities, Rainford said. (Rainford is a Madison-area field representative for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, but said he was speaking only for himself and not the public employee union.)\n\nUndocumented workers do not qualify for public benefits like Obamacare or government-subsidized health care \u2015 meaning they have to \u201clabor without the basic social protections that are part of our social and legal compact, are easily exploited, suffer sub-market wages and benefits and are denied many of the basic minimums that we have agreed upon as a society,\u201d Rainford said.\n\nBut raising wages could leave farmers short when the sometimes-volatile price of milk drops, Oconto Falls farmer Tim O\u2019Harrow said at a forum on the future of the immigrant dairy workforce in Madison last month.\n\n\u201cIf we pay [workers] more, how do I get the money out of you [consumers]?\u201d O\u2019Harrow asked attendees at the Cap Times Idea Fest. \u201cMilk is a commodity. We don\u2019t control the price.\u201d\n\nImmigrant labor \u201ckeeps the economy of rural Wisconsin humming,\u201d argued Brad Barham, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt is not replaceable by domestic labor \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nCoburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism Uriel Lopez, left, has worked at Ripp's Dairy Valley farm for 10 years. Here he is seen in the milking parlor with Eddy Aquilera. Eleven of the 12 non-family members who work at Ripp's dairy are Latino immigrants.\n\nHow much is fair?\n\nFarmers insist their immigrant workers are paid fairly, and that pay is rising.\n\nIn just the past year and a half, Ripp said, his farm boosted starting wages from $8.50 an hour to $11 \u2014 plus housing \u2014 as the flow of immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border has slowed. Workers with their own housing start at $12 an hour, he said. Some of his longer-tenured Latino workers earn $15 an hour.\n\nDane County, where the Ripp farm is located, considers $12.50 an hour and above to be a living wage.\n\nAmerica\u2019s No. 1 milk producer, California, is raising the minimum wage for nearly all workers, including those in agriculture. By 2023, farmers and other employers will have to pay at least $15 an hour. Employees working more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week also will be eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBut raising pay too much could hurt the dairy industry, which has been hit by low milk prices, Chuck Ripp said in an interview.\n\n\u201cAs labor costs go up, people go out of business, plain and simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it gets too high, people are going to say, \u2018I just can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re going to lose some farms. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the economy wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could probably get [U.S. workers] to come with a lot higher wages,\u201d Ripp added. \u201cBut the turnover would be very high.\u201d Troy Ripp said that it would probably take three to four domestic workers to cover the shifts that one of his immigrant laborers is willing to work.\n\nJohn Hart/Wisconsin State Journal A robotic feeder made by GEA Farm Technologies makes its way through the cow barn at the De Buhr farm in Lancaster, Wisconsin, on Aug. 31, 2017. Mechanization has increased on dairy farms as farmers struggle to find enough workers.\n\nMachines vs. immigrants\n\nFarms can deal with labor shortages with the help of Congress, increased automation and better pay and benefits, said Philip Martin, a professor emeritus of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis.\n\nMartin said farm owners need to increase mechanization \u2014 such as automatic cow feeders and robotic milking systems \u2014 to improve productivity, make jobs less physically demanding and ultimately shrink the size of the workforce. Similar labor-saving devices have led to a sharp decline in the proportion of the U.S. workforce engaged in agriculture, he noted. About 200 years ago, 72 percent of the country\u2019s employees worked on farms. Today, that figure is less than 2 percent.\n\nMark Misch sees the trend toward mechanization as he travels the Upper Midwest selling cow water beds, which are considered more comfortable for the animals.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are looking into robots to replace the labor, having a robot do it,\u201d said Misch, who works for DCC Waterbeds in Sun Prairie. \u201cIt could be a robot that milks the cows. It could be a robot that feeds the cows. There\u2019s robots that push the feed up to the cows, so the people don\u2019t have to do those jobs.\u201d\n\nFormer ag secretary: Change the law\n\nMore machines and better pay will not be enough, Martin says. He noted that Congress is considering expanding the guest worker program to include dairy workers.\n\nCurrently, the so-called H-2A program is confined to seasonal farm workers. Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) has proposed allowing dairy farms to bring in guest workers, calling it \u201ca small starting point of relief\u201d for farmers in need of labor. The measure passed the House Appropriations Committee in July, but still needs full House and Senate approval.\n\nDept of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection Then-Wisconsin Agriculture Secretary Ben Brancel meets with Henry and Carol Ebert during Farm Technology Days in Algoma, Wisconsin, June 6, 2017. Brancel, who retired in August, says the United States should change immigration law to accommodate the growing number of immigrants working in the dairy industry.\n\nBen Brancel, Wisconsin\u2019s recently retired agriculture secretary, agrees that immigration law needs to be changed. Brancel, who served as a Republican lawmaker and state-level director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said politicians in Washington, D.C., need to stop arguing immigration policy \u201cat the extremes\u201d and adopt law changes that recognize the need for immigrant labor in agriculture while still limiting the people who can qualify for citizenship.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately right now, there isn\u2019t any stability in immigration policy,\u201d said Brancel, who retired from public service in August to run his beef cattle farm in central Wisconsin.\n\nChuck Ripp also wants changes. He worries about his workers being arrested because some cannot legally drive in Wisconsin. And some of his employees \u2015 such as Sergio Rivera, who has worked on the Ripp farm for 14 years \u2014 can go long periods without seeing their extended families because they fear being barred re-entry into the United States.\n\n\u201cI like [to go] back to Mexico to see my family... but right now it\u2019s just more hard,\u201d said Rivera, who cares for calves on the farm.\n\nCoburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism Dairy cows are seen in a freestall barn on a farm in northern Buffalo County, Wisconsin, on March 8, 2017. Wisconsin is the nation's No. 2 milk producer and No. 1 cheese producer. Farmers here say tougher immigration policies are making it more difficult to find and keep workers.\n\nBeing denied re-entry would mean Rivera would be separated from his wife and daughter, who live with him on the farm. That bothers Ripp.\n\n\u201cI really like these guys. I get to know them well, they\u2019re working hard for me,\u201d Ripp said. \u201cIt would be nice for me to know that Sergio could go home and then in a month come back. But right now, we\u2019re all afraid that once they leave, once they go into Mexico, can they get back into America?\u201d\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that some immigrant workers are leaving Wisconsin in the face of heightened enforcement.\n\nIn the Chicago regional office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which encompasses six states including Wisconsin, arrests are up under Trump, from an average of 538 per month at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency to an average of 776 per month for the first six months under Trump.\n\nAt the same time, deportation rates have gone down, in part because of record backlogs in the courts. In the Chicago region, the pending case backlog is about 25,700, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n\nDespite the threat of arrest emanating from Washington, Harrison, the former UW-Madison faculty member, said she does not expect a wave of voluntary departures.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who are desperate to be here to work,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cSo they\u2019ll keep a low profile. They\u2019ll say \u2018yes\u2019 to what\u2019s offered to them. They\u2019ll make as much money as they can while they can.

There are only four drugs that have been approved to treat the symptoms of the disease, and the most recent drug approval happened in 2003.\n\n2017 in particular has been a tough year for Alzheimer's failures. In February alone, Lundbeck discontinued two of its trials, Merck discontinued one of its studies, and Accera failed a late-stage trial as well. Axovant's trial results are the last major results to come out in 2017, with the next ones reading out in 2018 and a major wave of results expected in 2019.\n\nStarting earlier\n\nResearch has determined that years \u2014 even decades \u2014 before a person might start showing symptoms, amyloid beta deposits in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease can start to accumulate. By the time we start seeing symptoms of dementia, researchers think, it might already be too late to do much.\n\nSo preventing any progression at that stage is something researchers are pinning a lot of hope on. There's one research effort going on in Colombia that's testing out an amyloid-related drug in an extended family with a rare genetic mutation that leads to early-onset Alzheimer's. That study is in people who are still considered cognitively healthy, so if the drug is able to prevent cognitive decline, it could be a breakthrough.\n\nWhat's ahead\n\nAccording to PhRMA, there are more than a dozen experimental treatments that are still in phase 3, the latest stage of clinical trials before companies present their data to the FDA. Here are some of the ones to look out for in the next year or two.\n\nVTV Therapeutics, a small company in North Carolina, has an Alzheimer's drug in late-stage trials called azeliragon that inhibits the RAGE receptor, ideally helping people with mild Alzheimer's delay cognitive decline. Its phase 3 trial is expected to wrap up in early 2018. The company got encouraging phase 2 results on the drug, which has been in the works for about 17 years.

Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter to deliver an unusually raw tweetstorm defending the company\u2019s software algorithms against critics who believe Facebook needs more oversight.\n\nFacebook uses algorithms to determine everything from what you see and don\u2019t see in News Feed, to finding and removing other content like hate speech and violent threats. The company has been criticized in the past for using these algorithms \u2014 and not humans \u2014 to monitor its service for things like abuse, violent threats, and misinformation.\n\nThe algorithms can be fooled or gamed, and part of the criticism is that Facebook and other tech companies don\u2019t always seem to appreciate that algorithms have biases, too.\n\nStamos says it\u2019s hard to understand from the outside.\n\n\u201cNobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral.

This means individual employees rarely speak to the press, and when they do, it\u2019s usually to deliver a bunch of prepared statements. Companies sometimes fire employees who speak to journalists without permission, and Facebook executives are particularly tight-lipped.\n\nThis makes Stamos\u2019s thread, and his candor, very intriguing. Here it is in its entirety.\n\nI appreciate Quinta's work (especially on Rational Security) but this thread demonstrates a real gap between academics/journalists and SV. https://t.co/CWulZrFaso \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) October 7, 2017\n\nI appreciate Quinta's work (especially on Rational Security) but this thread demonstrates a real gap between academics/journalists and SV. I am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech cos. Nobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral. Nobody is not aware of the risks. In fact, an understanding of the risks of machine learning (ML) drives small-c conservatism in solving some issues. For example, lots of journalists have celebrated academics who have made wild claims of how easy it is to spot fake news and propaganda. Without considering the downside of training ML systems to classify something as fake based upon ideologically biased training data. A bunch of the public research really comes down to the feedback loop of \"we believe this viewpoint is being pushed by bots\" -> ML So if you don't worry about becoming the Ministry of Truth with ML systems trained on your personal biases, then it's easy! Likewise all the stories about \"The Algorithm\". In any situation where millions/billions/tens of Bs of items need to be sorted, need algos My suggestion for journalists is to try to talk to people who have actually had to solve these problems and live with the consequences. And to be careful of their own biases when making leaps of judgment between facts. If your piece ties together bad guys abusing platforms, algorithms and the Manifestbro into one grand theory of SV, then you might be biased If your piece assumes that a problem hasn't been addressed because everybody at these companies is a nerd, you are incorrect. If you call for less speech by the people you dislike but also complain when the people you like are censored, be careful. Really common. If you call for some type of speech to be controlled, then think long and hard of how those rules/systems can be abused both here and abroad Likewise if your call for data to be protected from governments is based upon who the person being protected is. A lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking SV to build. When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.

The Times investigation found that Mr. Weinstein had settled with at least eight women over the years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board\u2019s independent investigation, and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gross, yeah,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cI\u2019m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, \u2018I have caused a lot of pain.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe had previously described Mr. Weinstein as \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women\u2019s rights lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHad I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cWhile I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, \u201cSuspicion Nation,\u201d was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.\n\nAfter the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAuthors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein \u201cfor a long time,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised to see it.\u201d", "summary": "\u201cI have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Ms. Bloom said on Twitter on Saturday morning.\nBut he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.\nHer work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women\u2019s rights lawyer.\nOne of the books, \u201cSuspicion Nation,\u201d was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.\nAfter the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers.", "score": -20}, {"source": "TechCrunch", "title": "How \u201canonymous\u201d wifi data can still be a privacy\u00a0risk", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/07/how-anonymous-wifi-data-can-still-be-a-privacy-risk/", "top_image_url": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/pub17_031-wifi_fig01.jpg", "description": "The thorny issue of tracking of location data without risking individual privacy is very neatly illustrated via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request asking..", "authors": "Natasha Lomas", "category": "technology", "date": "10 hours ago", "text": "The thorny issue of tracking of location data without risking individual privacy is very neatly illustrated via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request asking London\u2019s transport regulator to release the \u201canonymized\u201d data-set it generated from a four week trial last year when it tracked metro users in the UK capital via wi-fi nodes and the MAC address of their smartphones as they traveled around its network.\n\nAt the time TfL announced the pilot it said the data collected would be \u201cautomatically de-personalised\u201d. Its press release further added that it would not be able to identify any individuals.\n\nIt said it wanted to use the data to better understand crowding and \u201ccollective travel patterns\u201d so that \u201cwe can improve services and information provision for customers\u201d.\n\n(Though it\u2019s since emerged TfL may also be hoping to generate additional marketing revenue using the data \u2014 by, a spokesman specifies, improving its understanding of footfall around in-station marketing assets, such as digital posters and billboards, so not by selling data to third parties to target digital advertising at mobile devices.)\n\nPress coverage of the TfL wi-fi tracking trial has typically described the collected data as anonymized and aggregated.\n\nThose Londoners not wanting to be tracked during the pilot, which took place between November 21 and December 19 last year, had to actively to switch off the wi-fi on their devices. Otherwise their journey data was automatically harvested when they used 54 of the 270 stations on the London Underground network \u2014 even if they weren\u2019t logged onto/using station wi-fi networks at the time.\n\nHowever in an email seen by TechCrunch, TfL has now turned down an FOI request asking for it to release the \u201cfull dataset of anonymized data for the London Underground Wifi Tracking Trial\u201d \u2014 arguing that it can\u2019t release the data as there is a risk of individuals being re-identified (and disclosing personal data would be a breach of UK data protection law).\n\n\u201cAlthough the MAC address data has been pseudonymised, personal data as defined under the [UK] Data Protection Act 1998 is data which relate to a living individual who can be identified from the data, or from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller,\u201d TfL writes in the FOI response in which it refuses to release the dataset.\n\n\u201cGiven the possibility that the pseudonymised data could, if it was matched against other data sets, in certain circumstances enable the identification of an individual, it is personal data. The likelihood of this identification of an individual occurring would be increased by a disclosure of the data into the public domain, which would increase the range of other data sets against which it could be matched.\u201d\n\nSo what value is there in data being \u201cde-personalized\u201d \u2014 and a reassuring narrative of \u2018safety via anonymity\u2019 being spun to smartphone users whose comings and goings are being passively tracked \u2014 if individual privacy could still be compromised?\n\nAt this point we\u2019ve seen enough examples of data sets being sold and re-identified or shared and re-identified that for large scale data-sets that are being collected claims of anonymity are dubious \u2014 or at least need to be looked at very carefully.\n\n\u201cAt this point we\u2019ve seen enough examples of data sets being sold and re-identified or shared and re-identified that for large scale data-sets that are being collected claims of anonymity are dubious \u2014 or at least need to be looked at very carefully,\u201d says Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a lecturer in computational privacy at Imperial College\u2019s Data Science Institute, discussing the contradictions thrown up by the TfL wi-fi trial.\n\nHe dubs the wi-fi data collection trial\u2019s line on privacy as a \u201creally thorny one\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe data per se is not anonymous,\u201d he tells TechCrunch. \u201cIt is not impossible to re-identify if the raw data were to be made public \u2014 it is very likely that one might be able to re-identify individuals in this data set. And to be honest, even TfL, it probably would not be too hard for them to match this data \u2014 for example \u2014 with Oyster card data [aka London\u2019s contactless travelcard system for using TfL\u2019s network].\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re specifically saying they\u2019re not doing it but it would not be hard for them to do it.\u201d\n\nOther types of data that, combined with this large scale pseudonymised wifi location dataset could be used to re-identify individuals, might include mobile phone data (such as data held by a carrier) or data from apps on phones, de Montjoye suggests.\n\nIn one of his previous research studies, looking at credit card metadata, he found that just four random pieces of information were enough to re-identify 90 per cent of the shoppers as unique individuals.\n\nIn another study he co-authored, called Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility, he and his fellow researchers write: \u201cIn a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier\u2019s antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95% of the individuals\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, London\u2019s Tube network handles up to five million passenger journeys per day \u2014 the vast majority of whom would be carrying at least one device with embedded wi-fi making their movements trackable.\n\nThe TfL wi-fi trial tracked journeys on about a fifth of the London Underground network for a month.\n\nA spokesman confirms it is now in discussions, including with the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, about how it could implement a permanent rollout on the network. Though he adds there\u2019s no specific timeframe in the frame as yet.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re saying how do we do this going forward, basically,\u201d says the TfL spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re saying is there anything we can do better\u2026 We\u2019re actively meeting with the ICO and privacy groups and key stakeholders to talk us through what our plans will be for the future\u2026 and how can we work with you to look to take this forward.\u201d\n\nOn the webpage where it provides privacy information about the wifi trial for its customers, TfL writes:\n\nEach MAC address collected during the pilot will be de-personalised (pseudonymised) and encrypted to prevent the identification of the original MAC address and associated device. The data will be stored in a restricted area of a secure server and it will not be linked to any other data. As TfL will not be able to link this data to any other information about you or your device, you will not receive any information by email, text, push message or any other means, as a result this pilot.\n\nThe spokesman tells us that the MAC addresses were encrypted twice, using a salt key in the second instance, which he specifies was destroyed at the end of the trial, claiming: \u201cSo there was no way you could ascertain what the MAC address was originally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only reason we\u2019re saying de-personalized, rather than anonymized\u2026 is in order to understand how people are moving through the station you have to be able to have the same code going through the station [to track individual journeys],\u201d he adds. \u201cSo we could understand that particular scrambled code, but we had no way of working out who it was.\u201d\n\nHowever de Montjoye points out that TfL could have used daily keys, instead of apparently keeping the same salt keys for a month, to reduce the resolution of the information being gathered \u2014 and shrink the re-identification risk to individuals.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is whether \u2014 and one thing we\u2019ve really been strongly advocating for \u2014 is to really try to take into account the full set of solutions, including security mechanisms to prevent the re-identification of [large scale datasets] even if the data is pseudoanonymous,\u201d he says. \u201cMeaning for example ensuring that there is no way someone can access, both the dataset or try to take auxiliary information and try to re-identify people through security mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I have not seen anything that describes anything that they would have put in place to prevent these kind of attacks,\u201d he adds of the TfL trial.\n\nHe also points out that the specific guidance produced by the UK ICO on wi-fi location analytics recommends data controllers strike a balance between the uses they want to make of data vs collecting excessive data (and thus the risk of re-identification).\n\nThe same guidance also emphasizes the need to clearly inform and be transparent with data subjects about the information being gathered and what it will be used for.\n\nYet, in the TfL instance, busy London Underground commuters would have had to actively switch off all the wi-fi radios on all their devices to avoid their travel data being harvested as they rushed to work \u2014 and might easily have missed posters TfL said it put up in stations to inform customers about the trial.\n\n\u201cOne could at least question whether they\u2019ve been really respecting this guidance,\u201d argues de Montjoye.\n\nTfL\u2019s spokesman has clearly become accustomed to being grilled by journalists on this topic, and points to comments made by UK information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, last month who, when asked about the trial at a local government oversight meeting, described it as \u201ca really good example of a public body coming forward with a plan, a new initiative, consulting us deeply and doing a proper privacy impact assessment\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe agreed with them that at least for now, in the one-way hash that they wanted to implement for the trial, it was not reversible and it was impossible at this point to identify or follow the person through the various Tube station,\u201d Denham added. \u201cI would say it is a good example of privacy by design and good conversations with the regulator to try to get it right. There is a lot of effort there.\u201d\n\nEven so, de Montjoye\u2019s view that large-scale location tracking operations need to not just encrypt personally identifiable data properly but also implement well designed security mechanisms to control how data is collected and can be accessed is difficult to argue with \u2014 with barely a week going by without news breaking of yet another large scale data breach.\n\nEquifax is just one of the most recent (and egregious) examples. Many more are available.\n\nWhile much more personal data is leeching into the public domain where it can be used to cross-reference and unlock other pieces of information, further increasing re-identification risks.\n\n\u201cThey are reasonably careful and transparent about what they do which is good and honestly better than a lot of other cases,\u201d says de Montjoye of TfL, though he also reiterates the point about using daily keys, and wonders: \u201cAre they going to keep the same key forever if it becomes permanent?\u201d\n\nHe reckons the most important issue likely remains whether the data being collected here \u201ccan be considered anonymous\u201d, pointing again to the ICO guidance which he says: \u201cClearly states that \u2018If an individual can be identified from that MAC address, or other information in the possession of the network operator, then the data will be personal data'\u201d \u2014 and pointing out that TfL holds not just Oyster card data but also contactless credit and debit card data (bank cards can also be used to move around its transport network), meaning it has various additional large scale data-holdings which could potentially offer a route for re-identifying the \u2018anonymous\u2019 location dataset.\n\n\u201cMore generally, the FOIA example nicely emphasize the difficulties (for the lack of a better word) of the use of the word anonymous and, IMHO, the issue its preponderance in our legal framework raises,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe and PCAST have argued that de-identification is not a useful basis for policy and we need to move to proper security-based and provable systems.\u201d\n\nAsked why, if it\u2019s confident the London Underground wi-fi data is truly anonymized it\u2019s also refusing to release the dataset to the public as asked (by a member of the public), TfL\u2019s spokesman tells us: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re not releasing it because you could say that I know that someone was the only person in the station at that particular time. Therefore if I could see that MAC address, even if it\u2019s scrambled, I can then say well that\u2019s the code for that person and then I can understand where they go \u2014 therefore we\u2019re not releasing it.\u201d\n\nSo, in other words, anonymized data is only private until the moment it\u2019s not \u2014 i.e. until you hold enough other data in your hand to pattern match and reverse engineer its secrets.\n\n\u201cWe made it very clear throughout the pilot we would not release this data to third parties and that\u2019s why we declined the FOI response,\u201d the spokesman adds as further justification for denying the FOI request. And that at least is a more reassuringly solid rational.", "summary": "Press coverage of the TfL wi-fi tracking trial has typically described the collected data as anonymized and aggregated.\n\u201cGiven the possibility that the pseudonymised data could, if it was matched against other data sets, in certain circumstances enable the identification of an individual, it is personal data.\nHe dubs the wi-fi data collection trial\u2019s line on privacy as a \u201creally thorny one\u201d.\nThe TfL wi-fi trial tracked journeys on about a fifth of the London Underground network for a month.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re saying how do we do this going forward, basically,\u201d says the TfL spokesman.", "score": -20}, {"source": "Time", "title": "Lisa Bloom Resigns as Lawyer for Embattled Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein", "url": "http://time.com/4973591/lisa-bloom-resigns-harvey-weinstein-lawyer/", "top_image_url": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-hollywood-sexual-harassment.jpg?w=720", "description": "Harvey Weinstein is confronting sexual harassment allegations", "authors": "Associated Press", "category": "general", "date": "13 hours ago", "text": "Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman and co-founder of Weinstein Co., attends the second day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 12, 2017 in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nHarvey Weinstein, co-chairman and co-founder of Weinstein Co., attends the second day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 12, 2017 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

So far, Facebook has found about 3,000 ads bought by Kremlin sources, while Twitter has found about 200 accounts tied to Russia.

And as reports emerged about the extent of Russia\u2019s attempts to spread disinformation in 2016 by preying on users\u2019 racial, religious or other characteristics, the tech giants promised additional checks still to come. This week, for example, Facebook informed advertisers that it would begin subjecting more of their content to manual review.\n\nSome of the commitments have drawn some early, tentative praise from the three black lawmakers \u2014 Kelly, Watson Coleman, and Cleaver \u2014 who wrote Facebook and Twitter on Friday.
