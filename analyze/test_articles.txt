When the son, a medic, stopped to help someone, Phippen stayed with him and was shielding a woman when he was shot dead, said a neighbor, Leah Nagiyvanyi.\n\nAttorneys for Phippen's family filed the petition Friday in District Court in Clark County. The petition asks a judge to appoint the county's public administrator to account for and control Paddock's estate -- in part to make it available for any future lawsuits filed by the shooting victims.\n\nPaddock, a gambler and retired accountant, owned a home in Mesquite, Nevada, and his brother has said he was a successful real estate investor who owned apartments and houses. Sales agents told CNN that Paddock paid $369,022 in cash for his Mesquite home in 2014.\n\nThe court \"will notify (Paddock's) family members, and we'll see where this goes,\" said Richard A. Patterson, a California attorney representing Phippen's son Travis.\n\n\"We want (Paddock's estate) administered by the court.

The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cAs Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNext steps will depend on Harvey\u2019s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board\u2019s independent investigation, and Harvey\u2019s own personal decisions.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gross, yeah,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cI\u2019m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, \u2018I have caused a lot of pain.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe had previously described Mr. Weinstein as \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women\u2019s rights lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHad I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cWhile I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, \u201cSuspicion Nation,\u201d was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.\n\nAfter the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAuthors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein \u201cfor a long time,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised to see it.\u201d",

after failing to pass legislation through Congress repealing President Obama\u2019s signature law.\n\nThe administration has cut funding for advertising and outreach by 90 percent, raising the odds that fewer people will join the health-care exchanges during the fall enrollment period.\n\nIt has slashed funds by 41 percent for outside groups that help reach and enroll likely ObamaCare consumers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe enrollment period has also been chopped in half, and the administration announced plans to take down the Healthcare.gov website for maintenance for hours at a time on several days during the sign-up period, two other steps likely to cut into enrollment.\n\nAll of these steps could lead fewer people to sign up for the law, which in turn might lead to higher premiums that could force others off the exchanges.\n\nHealthy people are the most likely to drop coverage because of a lack of outreach, leaving a sicker group of enrollees that drives up costs for everyone else.\n\n\u201cOne has to assume at this point that enrollment will be lower as a result of the administration\u2019s actions and that will lead to fewer healthier people signing up,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe Trump attacks go beyond enrollment, too.\n\nPresident Trump has threatened to cut off key ObamaCare payments to insurers in a bid to make the law \u201cimplode.\u201d\n\nAnd on Friday, his administration took a new step to roll back the law, limiting the requirement for employers and insurance plans to cover birth control.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a former top health-care official in the Obama administration, warned on Twitter Thursday that the administration\u2019s \u201csabotage\u201d of the law added up to what he called \u201csynthetic repeal,\u201d meaning a range of small steps that add up to repealing ObamaCare even if Congress doesn\u2019t act.\n\nThe administration counters that ObamaCare is a failing law that should not be propped up.\n\n\u201cObamacare has never lived up to enrollment expectations despite the previous administration\u2019s best efforts,\u201d a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cThe American people know a bad deal when they see one and many won\u2019t be convinced to sign up for \u2018Washington-knows-best\u2019 health coverage that they can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nThe cuts are having real world consequences already.\n\nReducing the outreach budget has forced local organizations known as navigators to dramatically scale back their operations.\n\nShelli Quenga, director of programs at the Palmetto Project, a navigator group in South Carolina, said her organization has had to cut staff from 62 people to 30 after its funding was reduced by around 50 percent.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about designed to fail?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the playbook for how to build something to make sure it fails.\u201d\n\nQuenga said that she only found out about the cut to her organization\u2019s funding after the administration publicly made an announcement about the navigator cuts and she was called by a reporter for reaction.\n\nShe said the career officials she works with at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were not aware of or involved in the decision to cut the funding, saying the decision was made at higher levels of the administration.\n\nNavigators across the country had to scramble to craft new plans ahead of the open enrollment period beginning on Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just feeling very anxious about the fact that we have a whole lot less time to gear up then we should have had,\u201d said Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids and Families, which is affiliated with the University of South Florida.\n\n\u201cWe had a very well thought out plan, and we definitely had to go back and revise that plan, except we didn\u2019t plan on having 3.5 weeks to put it together,\u201d said Ray, whose group will receive $900,000 less, a 15 percent reduction.\n\nA group of former Obama administration officials this week announced plans to launch their own enrollment effort, called Get America Covered, to try to fill the gap left by the cuts.\n\nInsurers and ObamaCare supporters are also on edge about an executive order from Trump that could come as soon as next week loosening rules to allow businesses and other groups to band together to purchase health insurance. The problem is that these special insurance plans are not subject to the same ObamaCare rules and pre-existing condition protections, which could suck the healthy enrollees out of ObamaCare plans and damage the market.\n\nThe administration has also resisted efforts by some states, even conservative ones, to make changes aimed at stabilizing ObamaCare.\n\nIowa submitted an innovation waiver, which lets states alter ObamaCare as long as the law\u2019s basic protections are retained. Part of the proposal included conservative reforms to the Affordable Care Act, yet President Trump reportedly wasn\u2019t on board.\n\nTrump saw a story about the waiver in The Wall Street Journal, and asked CMS to deny it, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe application has not been formally rejected, at least not yet. It is in the midst of a 30-day public comment period, and is still pending, an Iowa Insurance Division spokesman confirmed to The Hill.\n\nBut without it, Iowa\u2019s Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen has warned the impact \u201con many Iowa families would be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nThe deep-red state of Oklahoma had sought a waiver to help stabilize its markets, but withdrew it at the end of September because it hadn\u2019t received approval from the administration in time.\n\nThe withdrawal came even after \u201cmonths of development, negotiation and near daily communication over the past six weeks\u201d between the state and the administration, Oklahoma wrote in a letter complaining to the administration about the lack of action.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the work of your staff, the lack of timely waiver approval will prevent thousands of Oklahomans from realizing the benefits of significantly lower insurance premiums in 2018,\u201d wrote Terry Cline, Oklahoma\u2019s Commissioner of Health.", "description": "The Trump administration is taking a hatchet to ObamaCare after failing to pass legislation through Congress repealing President Obama\u2019s signature law.", "authors": "Peter Sullivan and Rachel Roubein", "top_image_url": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/trump_meadows_ryan.jpg", "summary": "The Trump administration is taking a hatchet to ObamaCare after failing to pass legislation through Congress repealing President Obama\u2019s signature law.\nIt has slashed funds by 41 percent for outside groups that help reach and enroll likely ObamaCare consumers.\nThe administration counters that ObamaCare is a failing law that should not be propped up.\nThe problem is that these special insurance plans are not subject to the same ObamaCare rules and pre-existing condition protections, which could suck the healthy enrollees out of ObamaCare plans and damage the market.\nIowa submitted an innovation waiver, which lets states alter ObamaCare as long as the law\u2019s basic protections are retained.", "date": "2017-10-07T16:04:03Z"}, {"url": "http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/07/556396555/pence-in-las-vegas-we-are-united-in-our-resolve-to-end-such-evil", "title": "Pence In Las Vegas: 'We Are United In Our Resolve To End Such Evil'", "text": "Pence In Las Vegas: 'We Are United In Our Resolve To End Such Evil'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSix days after the shooting along the Strip, Vice President Mike Pence visited Las Vegas, and told residents that America is united with their city in grief.\n\n\"We do mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope,\" he said. \"Because heroes give us hope.\"\n\nPresident Trump was in Las Vegas on Wednesday, when he visited some victims of the shooting at a local hospital and met with first responders.

We know that. We've been hit over the head with it. But the bottom line is starting to loom bigger than the robust Spartan defense that shut down the punchless Wolverine offense Saturday night.\n\nCoach Khaki is 1-4 against his alma mater's two biggest rivals. If it hasn't already, that will soon become an issue.\n\nSo will this unsavory nugget: Harbaugh is 13-3 at home halfway through his third season. All three losses are to the hated Buckeyes and Spartans.\n\nAs much as they love Harbaugh here, they hate Ohio State more. He is 0-2 against the Buckeyes. Since Harbaugh took the job three years ago, Mark Dantonio has beaten Michigan twice himself and taken the Spartans to the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"It's up there,\" Coach D said of the win, raising his hand as high as it would reach. \"Way up there.\"\n\nHalfway through that Year 3, Harbaugh has a pair of third-place finishes in the Big Ten East and growing uncertainty.\n\nToo soon?\n\nJudging by Saturday, Harbaugh probably won't win a Big Ten title until at least 2018. There are hurdles to clear before we consider Michigan-under-Harbaugh a conference contender.\n\nThey are colored scarlet and gray, green and white.\n\nIf there's one thing that gets folks' attention around here, it's Michigan losing face. Rich Rodriguez shamed them. So did Brady Hoke, but halfway through his third season, he was 2-3 against Michigan State and Ohio State.\n\nThere are giant holes in these Wolverines that were exposed before and during a second-half deluge.\n\nQuarterback John O'Korn has been in the program for three years. There is a reason the Houston transfer hasn't played much until now, when he had to be inserted because of an injury to starter Wilton Speight.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for this loss,\" O'Korn said.\n\nHe shouldn't have to.\n\nBoth quarterbacks play behind an iffy offensive line. O'Korn got sacked four times, and if not for nifty feet, it would have been more. Michigan started the day tied for 92nd nationally in sacks allowed. That ranking will plummet.\n\nThose hard hits contributed to three picks thrown by O'Korn. Also, there is no difference-making running back to carry some of the offensive load.\n\nMichigan was expected to take a step back this season. What was it doing ranked No. 7 going into Saturday? It returned the fewest starters in the country, only one on defense. But didn't that happen to Ohio State last year? The Buckeyes managed to squeeze out 11 wins. Oh, and they beat the Wolverines.\n\nHarbs can do all the fully-clothed cannonballs he wants. He can conduct as many spring practices in Rome as the Pope can stand. He can troll his coaching peers on Twitter. Sooner or later, the fans will start to demand Harbaugh clear those hurdles.\n\nWhen asked what the reaction should be to that 1-4 mark, Harbaugh told me, \"I don't know. We're bowing our necks getting ready for the next game. That's our reaction.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his team had just turned it over five times without taking any away from Michigan State. His defense shut out the Spartans for the last 38 minutes. It kept Michigan State without a first down for 27 consecutive plays spanning parts of three quarters spanning nine possessions.\n\nThose accomplishments shouldn't be describing a disheartening loss.\n\nMichigan State has now gone 8-2 in a decade against Michigan for the first time ever. While only three-tenths of that record is on Harbaugh, it's another example of how emotion rules these blood rivalries.\n\nAll of that 8-2 has come since Mike Hart's \"Little Brother\" comment that took the rivalry to a new level.\n\n\"It's definitely talked about,\" Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke said. \"It's definitely played before the game.

More than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\n\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\n\n\"Two principal factors affect the size and strength of bores \u2026 the magnitude of the tidal range and the shape of the river at its estuary,\u201d said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at California's San Diego State University, in a 2005 interview with National Geographic.\n\nBarring extreme weather conditions, bores form only when a river\u2019s mouth is shallow, uniform, and resembles a funnel. Bore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\n\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver. As it encounters shallow water, the crest of the wave moves faster than its trough, sharpening its peak. Eventually, the wave breaks\u2014and a bore is born.\n\nSome tidal bores have global reputations for their beauty and destructive power. Each year, the U.K.\u2019s Severn River sees some 250 bores move upriver. The Lupar Benak bore in Sarawak, Malaysia, nearly drowned the British author Somerset Maugham during a 1949 visit. And as National Geographic reported in 2005, some bores in the Amazon have become tourist attractions, as thrill-seeking surfers try to ride them upriver.\n\nBut no bore is as well-known, or as large, as the Qiantang tidal bore, locally known as the \u201cSilver Dragon.\u201d Records for this tidal bore, which can be up to nine feet tall and travel up to 25 miles an hour, go back nearly 3,000 years. These records include some of the oldest written tide tables recovered in China.\n\nThe estuary\u2019s structure is textbook bore material. The Hangzhou Bay, into which the Qiantang river empties, is more than 60 miles across at its mouth, but it narrows to a gap less than 13 miles across where it meets the Qiantang. As high tides enter the bay, they\u2019re funneled in toward the river's mouth, spawning massive high tides and especially strong tidal bores.\n\nThese walls of water pack extraordinary power. Over the years, the Qiantang\u2019s bores have constructed a massive complex of sandbars with an estimated total volume of 42.5 billion cubic meters. That\u2019s enough sand to fill a box 2.6 miles to a side.", "description": "Tourists recently flocked to China's Qiantang River see this tidal bore, an upstream wave that's anything but boring.", "authors": "Michael Greshko", "top_image_url": "https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/709/759/smpost_1507347314998.jpg", "summary": "On This River, the Moon Fights Earth's Gravity and WinsOn October 6, more than a hundred thousand tourists gathered on the banks of China\u2019s Qiantang river to witness an extraordinary sight: a wall of water several feet tall racing its way upriver.\nMore than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\nBore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver.", "date": "2017-10-07T12:00:00Z"}, {"url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker-nazi-spy-fagone.html", "title": "This Woman Saved the Americas From the Nazis", "text": "View Images Elizebeth Friedman, here with her husband William, learned to crack codes when she took a job with an eccentric millionaire who was obsessed with Shakespeare.\n\nPhotograph Courtesy of the George C. Marshall Foundation, Lexington, Virginia.\n\nView Images Courtesy of HarperCollins\n\nElizebeth Friedman is probably not a name familiar to most of our readers. Introduce us to this remarkable woman\u2014and explain what drew you to her.\n\nWell, it\u2019s an amazing American story. A hundred years ago, a young woman in her early twenties became one of the greatest codebreakers America had ever seen. She taught herself how to solve secret messages without knowing the key. That\u2019s codebreaking. And she started from absolutely nothing.\n\nShe wasn't a mathematician. She was a poet. But she turned out to be a genius at solving these very difficult puzzles, and her solutions changed the 20th century. She caught gangsters and organized-crime kingpins during Prohibition. She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\n\nShe also helped to invent the modern science of secret writing\u2014cryptology\u2014that lies at the base of everything from government institutions like the NSA to the fluctuations of our daily online lives. Not bad for a Quaker girl from a small Indiana town! [Laughs]\n\nWe first meet Elizebeth at a mansion named Riverbank near Chicago that belonged to a notorious millionaire named George Fabyan. Paint a picture of this larger-than-life man\u2014and explain his obsession with Shakespeare.\n\nFabyan was a lot like William Randolph Hearst or Andrew Carnegie\u2014one of these incredibly wealthy Gilded Age multimillionaires who\u2019d made his fortune in the textiles industry. Unlike a lot of other Gilded Age rich men, Fabyan didn\u2019t go for lavish vacations on the French Riviera or collect art. He dreamed of discovering the secrets of nature. Although he was a high school drop-out, he saw himself as a great sponsor of science, somebody who used his fortune to bring together some of America\u2019s finest scientists and give them carte blanche to discover the secrets of the world.\n\nHe was very eccentric. He lived in a villa full of furniture that hung from the ceiling on chains. His couch and bed hung on chains. He was extremely suspicious of everyone around him. He kept a hive of honeybees inside his own personal house because he didn\u2019t trust them to make honey unless he surveilled them personally. [Laughs]\n\nOne of his obsessions was secret writing. He believed that Shakespeare wasn\u2019t the author of the famous plays, like Hamlet and Julius Caesar. He thought that they were written by one of Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries, the philosopher Francis Bacon.\n\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature. To do that he hired some of the world\u2019s most prominent Bacon and Shakespeare experts and brought them to Riverbank. That\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\n\nRelated: How Three Men You Probably Never Heard of Helped End WWII The British sailors boarded a sinking German U-boat, recovering vital Nazi documents and secret codebooks. This short animation by Mike Brookes is part of the Short Film Showcase. The filmmakers created the content presented, and the opinions expressed are their own, not those of National Geographic Partners.\n\nElizebeth cut her teeth as a codebreaker during Prohibition in the unlikely role of interdicting rumrunners. Set the scene for us\u2014and describe how she reacted to becoming a minor celebrity.\n\nAfter she left Riverbank in 1921, she moved to Washington and was soon recruited by the U.S. Treasury Department to fight illegal liquor smuggling that had grown because of Prohibition. Rumrunners used ships that could outrun the Coast Guard vessels to smuggle rum into the U.S. The Coast Guard was unable to stop them because the rumrunners got good at concealing their operations using coded radio messages. Thousands of these messages were piling up in the Coast Guard offices so they approached Elizebeth Friedman to get help reading them.\n\nBetween 1926-1930, she solved 20,000 smuggling messages per year in hundreds of different code systems. She did it all by hand with pencil and paper, before the era of computers. It was analog heroism.\n\nToward the end of the 1920s, she also began to testify in court against some of the biggest gangsters of the day. These criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages. She would go into court carrying her handbag, wearing a pink dress and hat with flower pins, and would explain to a jury exactly how she had intercepted these radio messages and decoded them.\n\nSome of these guys were very dangerous. She testified in one case in New Orleans against three lieutenants of Al Capone.\n\nAs a result, she became one of the most famous codebreakers in the world. She was known as the Lady Manhunter, or the Key Woman of the Keyman, \u201ckeyman\u201d being a nickname for a treasury agent, similar to G-Man in the FBI. She was on front pages from coast to coast and she hated all of it! [Laughs] She was a very modest person, and disdained what she later called the hero worship.\n\nThe publicity also created problems because codebreaking is normally a secret profession. You are revealing the secrets of people who are communicating secretly and the more you reveal about how you found those secrets, the easier you make it for people to conceal their future communications.\n\nView Images Elizebeth Friedman met Ian Fleming in the course of her intelligence work. He went on to write the James Bond novels.\n\nPhotograph by M. McKeown/Express/Getty\n\nToday, most codebreaking is done by computers. What sort of methods did Elizebeth have at her disposal?\n\nGreat question! She did everything with pencil and paper and a series of techniques, some of which had been around for hundreds of years and some she had to invent herself. Working with William Friedman, who later became her husband, in the early days of Riverbank, she created different approaches and attacks on secret messages that allowed her to pick apart garbled blocks of letters and arrange them into patterns that made sense.\n\nOver decades of practice, solving tens of thousands of messages every year, she developed an intuition, a way of thinking that made her one of the best in the world at seeing the shapes of words in a field of letters that nobody else could make sense of.\n\nHer achievements reached their peak in World War II in what came to be known as the \u201cinvisible war.\u201d Take us inside this murky world of espionage and counterintelligence.\n\nAfter Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and World War II began, the codebreaking team Elizabeth had built within the Coast Guard started to intercept and analyze messages that looked a lot like rumrunning messages but were actually being sent by Nazi spies. These spies were spreading into South America, which was a neutral continent then, and into the U.S. and Mexico. All of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.\n\nIn the process, she met figures from British intelligence. The British sent over a lot of young officers, who looked to all the world like they were just British chaps having a good time, but were actually spies. One was Ian Fleming, who would go on to write the James Bond novels. Another was a young Roald Dahl, who at that time was a handsome pilot in the RAF.\n\nShe also worked on the notorious Enigma codes. While Alan Turing was organizing large-scale attacks on enigma codes using algorithms and large electromechanical devices called bombes, Elizebeth was more narrowly focused on a couple of Enigma\u2019s systems being used by Nazi spies. That\u2019s how the notorious SS spy Johannes Siegfried Becker, nicknamed \u201cSargo,\u201d was encrypting reports he sent back from South America to Berlin.\n\nThe FBI considered Becker the most dangerous Nazi spy in the Western Hemisphere. He directed more than 50 agents from a base in Argentina, exchanging thousands of sensitive espionage reports with Germany, gathering information on U.S. and British military capabilities and instigating military coups in South American countries to swing governments toward the Nazis. Elizebeth\u2019s efforts led to the destruction of every Nazi spy network in South America, in particular the one run by \u201cSargo.\u201d\n\nYou write that, \u201cby any measure, Elizebeth was a great heroine of the Second World War.\u201d But her role was erased by J. Edgar Hoover. Explain what happened.\n\nThe FBI had responsibility for catching Nazi spies in South America and those were the networks that Elizebeth was tracking. So she was giving messages to the FBI and also providing them with materials so they could solve messages themselves. Without Elizebeth and her team, the FBI would have been completely lost.\n\nBut after the networks were destroyed toward the end of 1944, J. Edgar Hoover launched a publicity campaign to take credit for winning this invisible war, claiming that the FBI was solely responsible. He produced a film that was shown to U.S. troops called \u201cThe Battle of the United States,\u201d which portrayed the FBI as the main hero, and published articles in popular magazines about the FBI\u2019s great work. He did not credit Elizebeth or her team.\n\nTo this day historians wrongly praise Hoover and the FBI for achievements that were actually Elizebeth\u2019s. As a result, Americans have no idea that Elizebeth Friedman, a mother of two, was the great Nazi spy catcher of the war.\n\nThe National Security Agency hit the headlines with whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Describe the Friedmans role in its creation in 1952.\n\nElizabeth and William are the Adam and Eve of the NSA in the sense that they were present at the birth of U.S. codebreaking at Riverbank in 1916. Everything that happened afterward grew out of that time and place. Elizebeth also helped to invent the science that undergirds a lot of the NSA\u2019s work. But she had no direct role in the NSA\u2019s creation. It was her husband, William Friedman, who helped create it.\n\nThe Army codebreaking unit that William launched in the early 1930s, and led all through the war, decrypted Japanese cypher machines, leading to major U.S. victories. After the war that unit became absorbed into the agency that we now know as the NSA.\n\nWilliam was an NSA official for a number of years, until he began to believe that the NSA was collecting too much information and keeping too much of it classified. He became suspicious about the direction of an institution that, in many ways, he helped create, and eventually came to believe that the NSA\u2019s practices were a threat to democracy itself. In private letters, he made criticisms of the NSA that are reminiscent of Edward Snowden\u2019s criticisms decades later.\n\nYou write, \u201cThe world forgot about her and remembered him.\u201d Why do you think this was?\n\nSexism? [Laughs] Part of the reason she was forgotten after the war is because of secrecy. Her records were classified, stamped \u201cTop Secret Ultra,\u201d and carried off to what she called \u201cgovernment tombs.\u201d Thousands of pages of her decryptions and proof of everything she had done in the war were placed under lock and key in the National Archives until as late as the year 2000.\n\nAlong with many other American women who wrote codes during the war, she was told that if she ever spoke about it, even to her grandchildren, she would be prosecuted. So she didn\u2019t. As a result, for many years nobody knew what she had done in the war.\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.", "description": "Pioneering codebreaker Elizebeth Friedman, a poet and mother of two, smashed spy rings by solving secret messages.", "authors": "Simon Worrall", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/07/booktalk-code-friedman/elizebeth-and-william-F-098.jpg", "summary": "She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature.\nThat\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\nThese criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages.\nAll of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.", "date": "2017-10-07T04:01:00Z"}, {"url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/animals-anatomy-sound-communication.html", "title": "This Bug's Penis Is a Built-In Violin", "text": "View Images The water boatman can make quite a racket with its anatomy.\n\nPhotograph by Ingo Arndt, Minden Pictures, National Geographic Creative\n\nHow do you play a built-in trumpet?\n\nWhen a friend asked, \u201cDo elephants make that trumpeting sound through their nose or mouth?\u201d that prompted us to take a deeper look at how animals make some of their unique sounds.\n\nElephants\n\n\u201cMostly the trumpeting sound is made with the trunk only,\u201d among the African forest elephants studied at Cornell University\u2019s Elephant Listening Project says project director Peter Wrege via email.\n\nView Images Elephants like this African forest elephant make trumpeting sounds when they are excited, fearful, or happy.\n\nPhotograph by Carlton Ward, National Geographic Creative\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca bit like sounds we make by blowing air forcefully through mostly closed lips,\u201d though sometimes they add \u201ca bit of a \u2018voice.\u2019\u201d (Related: What Elephant Calls Mean: A User\u2019s Guide)\n\n\u201cTry it,\u201d Wrege suggests, \u201cbut be careful where.\u201d\n\nWrege thinks all of the sound, \u201cincluding the components added by the vocal fold vibration,\u201d is emitted from the end of the trunk\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be surprising, he says, if the mouth is involved in producing the trumpets as well, depending on the emotional state of the elephant.\n\nWrege says elephants make this sound \u201cin times of high excitement, fear, or happiness,\u201d among this species, and we can see why.

Here's what you need to know about Hurricane Nate 2017 and other potentially powerful storms:\n\nNATE'S PATH\n\nTropical Depression 19 became Tropical Storm Nate Thursday, when it savaged parts of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, killing at least 21 people there. As of Friday afternoon, the storm was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nForecasters predict the eye of the storm could hit just east of New Orleans by Saturday night or early Sunday, making it the third hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in six weeks. Hurricane warnings were announced for much of the northern Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nThe storm is likely to miss the areas most hard-hit by other recent hurricanes, from Puerto Rico to Houston. Still, there could be substantial damage and risk to life, if the storm continues to strengthen. (Read about how to survive in a natural disaster.)\n\nROLE OF WARMER WATER\n\nWaters over the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean remain very warm, a condition that helps hurricanes draw strength, upping wind speeds. Due to that warmth, this hurricane season was predicted to be more active than average.\n\n\"In short: atmospheric conditions [are] hurricane-friendly, and surface sea temperatures were warmer than usual,\" Michael Greshko reported for us recently.\n\n\"The Climate Prediction Center says that multiple conditions, such as a strong west African monsoon, have aligned to make the Caribbean Sea and part of the tropical Atlantic\u2014a storm-spawning area called the 'Main Development Region'\u2014particularly well-suited to hurricanes,\" Greshko wrote.\n\nAnd while scientists maintain that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change, two centuries of human fossil-fuel burning has altered temperatures just enough to almost certainly make this season's storms more powerful.\n\n\"In general, the way to think about it is: climate change has changed the environment that everything is happening in,\" Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, told National Geographic's Craig Welch. \"When you add in the climate's natural variability and then the right conditions come along, you can get a storm which is stronger than you might otherwise have expected.\"\n\nHOW HURRICANES WORK\n\nHurricanes form by drawing energy from warm ocean water and converting it into the mechanical energy of wind. Those that form in the Atlantic Basin\u2014which includes the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea\u2014are often spawned by late-summer thunderstorms that roll off the west coast of Africa near the Cabo Verde Islands.\n\nDue to the Earth's rotation, Atlantic hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise. They are one form of tropical cyclone, which also forms in the Pacific Ocean. In the western Pacific, these same storms are known as typhoons. However, storms that form in the Southern Hemisphere rotate clockwise.

They were imported from their native range by people\u2014in the case of the hippos, by the now-deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose private zoo the beasts escaped from.\n\nThe conventional view among ecologists is that these species and other expatriate herbivores are an ecological problem. A new study takes issue with that, arguing that we should welcome them in their new ranges. According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\n\nOf the 76 herbivores in the world that weigh more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds), 22 have substantial populations outside their native ranges, according to ecologist Erick Lundgren of Arizona State University and his colleagues. Of those 22, half are threatened or extinct in their native ranges.\n\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species. The aurochs that humans once painted on caves, for example, and later domesticated into modern cattle, is long since extinct\u2014but feral cattle run wild from Hawaii to Hong Kong.\n\nThough every population has its own story\u2014Pablo Escobar used his hippos to show off\u2014there are common themes. \u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\n\nDrug Kingpin Pablo Escobar\u2019s Hippos Are Alive and Well\n\nThe question now is how to think and what to do about them. Lundgren and co-author Arian Wallach, an ecologist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, say these animals are often bringing grazing back to landscapes where it has been missing. By grazing tree seedlings, large herbivores keep grasslands from turning into forest and reduce fire risk. By grazing in one place and pooping in another, they move nutrients around.\n\nIn Arizona Lundgren has even watched wild burros\u2014whose ancestors hail from North Africa\u2014dig water holes that are then used by coyotes, javelinas, bighorn sheep, and plants. But to a lot of Arizonans these days, the burros are pests that amble around town as if they own the place, and wreck cars by allowing themselves to get hit.\n\nThey Can\u2019t Go Home Again\n\nMany conservationists have argued that such wayward animals should be \u201cput back\u201d in their native habitats. But that often isn\u2019t possible, Wallach says. The one-humped dromedary camel is an example.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why these animals went extinct in the Middle East in the first place,\u201d she says. Wild camels were presumably hunted and domesticated out of existence, and today there\u2019s no obvious place in the Middle East or North Africa where they\u2019d be safe for a massive reintroduction effort. Besides, Wallach points out, although we tend to think that the dromedary \u201cbelongs\u201d in the Middle East\u2014because that is where humans first encountered and domesticated it\u2014the species actually evolved millions of years earlier in North America.\n\nToday, Wallach says, \u201ccamels are best suited to Australia,\u201d where they were introduced in the 19th century, and where there are now some 300,000 dromedaries wandering in the desert. Part of the reason she and her colleagues conducted their survey was to get people to realize that these non-native populations are often large and ecologically influential.\n\nWallach got the idea while looking at a map created by co-author William Ripple, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The map showed where large herbivores live on Earth, but Australia was completely empty\u2014despite the fact that, in addition to the world\u2019s only population of wild dromedaries, it currently hosts seven other introduced species of large herbivore, including donkeys, water buffalo, horses, the endangered banteng from Southeast Asia, and the vulnerable sambar deer, from India.\n\nBecause they aren\u2019t native, they weren\u2019t on Ripple\u2019s original map. This selective vision is widespread in ecology, and in practice it means that little is known about these populations. Even now, with the study complete, Lundgren is hearing about new populations with some regularity. \u201cI just found a new species that we missed,\u201d he says. \u201cGiant eland in Cuba. There\u2019s like 1,000.\u201d This uncommonly beautiful antelope is vulnerable to extinction in its native Africa.\n\n\u201cThese animals exist,\u201d says Lundgren. \u201cFor many of them the introduced home is the home they know more than anywhere else. We would spend a great deal of energy and time killing these animals if we were to try to go back to some pure historic baseline.\u201d Instead, he thinks it better to \u201copen our eyes to a wonder that we so often ignore and celebrate these animals.\u201d\n\nCelebrate Camels? Please.\n\nOther ecologists are not yet breaking out the champagne. Daniel Simberloff of the University of Tennessee studies the impact of non-native species on ecosystems, and he says Lundgren and his colleagues have unfairly stacked the deck, reporting only the positive impacts of the invasive herbivores and ignoring the problems they cause.\n\n\u201cCamels, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Simberloff says. \u201cThere is an entire book and many papers about the many inimical impacts\u2014ecological as well as economic and social, of feral camels.\u201d Indeed, studies suggest that the desert wanderers damage and foul water holes and springs, including those that have cultural significance to Aboriginal people. The taciturn beasts have also locally wiped out tasty plants such as the quandong, a delicious fruit in the sandalwood family.\n\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under. But \u201cthey don\u2019t have to roam over half of Australia.\u201d\n\nView Images Wild horses\u2014these are in the McCullough Peaks Herd Management Area near Cody, Wyoming\u2014are a contentious issue in the American West.\n\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic Creative\n\nOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory. But they say the devil is\u2014as always in ecology\u2014in the details. Eric Beever, a United States Geological Survey ecologist based in Bozeman, Montana, says that while some grazing on a landscape might be great, too much can reduce the diversity of other flora and fauna, from small mammals to plants. Without predators keeping these out-of-place herbivores in check, species like wild horses can becomes a real problem in the American West.\n\n\u201cI love riding horses,\u201d Beever says. \u201cIn a romantic sense it is a beautiful thing to watch them; from an ecologist\u2019s perspective\u2026.\u201d he trails off, then quotes ecologist Aldo Leopold. \u201cOne of the penalties of an ecological education,\u201d Leopold once wrote, \u201cis that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen.\u201d For Beever, the intensive grazing of wild horses\u2014though it\u2019s far outweighed by the impact of domestic cattle\u2014is one such wound.\n\nWallach, who isn\u2019t a layperson, doesn\u2019t see it that way. The landscape that so many ecologists associate with natural health in western North America isn\u2019t natural, she says. It was actually created by the extinction, starting more than 10,000 years ago, of the many large animals that lived in North America during the Pleistocene ice ages. Human hunters were the main culprit, and the result was a greener, woodsier world with less grazing in it.\n\n\u201cThe concept of \u2018overgrazing\u2019 tells us about ourselves,\u201d Wallach says. \u201cWhen one says animals are overgrazing, one is really saying \u2018I feel that this landscape has a grazing impact that I don\u2019t like.\u2019\u201d\n\nNext: Invasive Elephants?\n\nCornell ecologist Harry Greene, for one, is willing to go beyond celebrating the herbivores we\u2019ve already introduced. He thinks we should consider introducing more, as proxies for the Pleistocene animals that went extinct.\n\nNorth America used to host a lot of mammoths, and burros, wild horses, and cattle don\u2019t exactly replace these enormous browsers. Elephants might, though\u2014and Greene proposes we do an experiment to see how they would interact with a modern American ecosystem. \u201cWe have over 100 Asian elephants in the country now, and there is increasing sentiment to get them out of zoos,\u201d he says. Why not create a controlled herd, behind fences, and study them?\n\nThreatened by habitat loss and poaching in Africa and Asia, elephants might one day, in this view, find refuge in America. \u201cIf the only elephants left on earth were a North American herd that started with zoo animals, that would still be better than no elephants left on Earth at all,\u201d Greene says.", "description": "Feral horses or camels may not &quot;belong&quot; where we put them, a new study says, but they're keeping the species wild and helping the ecosystem.", "authors": "Emma Marris", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/06/invasive-species/05-invasive-animals-NationalGeographic_1737689.jpg", "summary": "According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species.\n\u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under.\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic CreativeOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory.", "date": "2017-10-06T16:42:44Z"}, {"url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/mexico-revillagigedo-oceans-pristine-seas-conservation-environment-spd.html", "title": "Largest Marine Protected Area in North America Created off Mexico", "text": "These Giant Manta Rays Just Want to Hang Out\n\nThe Mexican government has announced the creation of a new marine reserve in the Pacific Ocean Thursday, the largest protected area of its kind in North America.\n\nAlejandro Del Mazo Maza, representing Mexico\u2019s National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, announced the massive expansion of the Revillagigedo marine park on October 5 at the Our Ocean conference in Malta.\n\nThe park covers more than 57,000 square miles, a vast rectangle of ocean encompassing the four Revillagigedo Islands, small volcanic landmasses under Mexico's control that lie about 240 miles southwest of Baja California. The islands are uninhabited except for a small Mexican naval presence and were named a World Heritage Site in 2016 for their unique biodiversity (the reserve is also the location for the photo that won the National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest in 2015 .\n\nNORTH AMERICA EUROPE ASIA north pacific Ocean AFRICA SOUTH AMERICA AUSTRALIA South pacific Ocean ANTARCTICA Niue, New Zealand Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, Chile Cape Horn and Diego Ram\u00edrez Islands, Chile NG STAFF\n\n\u201cWith the goal of guaranteeing maximum protection of this World Heritage Site, our national legislation\u2019s strongest conservation category will be used, and all forms of fishing will be prohibited,\u201d Del Mazo said in a statement. He also said that Mexico will not permit the construction of hotel facilities on the islands.\n\nPreviously, the islands had been protected by a small reserve that included only the waters up to six miles off the land. That left important feeding and migration areas for sharks, rays, whales, and other species in the path of fishermen\u2014who either target the species, often illegally, or catch them accidentally as bycatch.\n\nBut the new park is designed to protect critical habitat for those animals, as well as corals and other fish. No fishing, mining, or other intensive resource development will be allowed in the newly expanded reserve.\n\n'Giant Manta Rays Galore'\n\n\"This is the wildest place in tropical North America,\" says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas fact-finding expedition to the area in March 2016. \"It\u2019s one of the places where you can see the most giant manta rays and sharks on the planet.\"\n\nDuring the expedition, the team of more than a dozen scientists saw \"giant manta rays galore,\" says Sala. \"We saw lots of sharks, groupers, and tuna. It was a rare place of large fish, with biodiversity as if the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands had opened a branch in Mexico.\"\n\nOn land, the islands are home to many sea and land birds, endemic reptiles, and unique plants.\n\nWith a DeepSee submersible and remote dropcams, the Pristine Seas team also surveyed a ridge about 300 feet beneath the surface. There, they found \"a beautiful soft coral garden,\" says Sala, packed with corals, sea fans, sponges, crabs, and fish.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nWhen proposed, the reserve saw some opposition from fishermen, but fishing fleets used only a small part of the waters, says Sala. Of the entire Pacific range fished by Mexico's tuna fleet, only seven percent of their effort was directed in the waters of the newly expanded reserve, he says.\n\nAnd what's more, Mexico's fishermen should see their catches in waters outside the reserve increase, says Sala, due to spill-over of growing fish populations in the protected waters. That's exactly what happened around the Gal\u00e1pagos after fishing was restricted in 1998, turning former adversaries of the reserve into supporters.\n\nThe reserve should also increase the amount of dive tourism to the area, which is already a $15 million business. Boats often leave out of the popular resort destination Cabo San Lucas, a few hundred miles away.\n\nEach living manta ray is worth 57 times more to Mexico's economy through increased tourism than the money received by selling its body parts to Asia, Sala's team calculated.\n\nThe next step will be enforcement of the reserve's new boundaries. Illegal fishermen have been operating there with sophistication, sometimes using helicopters to spot for enforcement vessels.\n\nThe reserve is the newest marine park that Sala and his Pristine Seas initiative at National Geographic helped bring into being.

Small villages continue to stand divided from stances taken during the war. For example, one of the oldest cinemas in Spain is located in the small village of Caseres, home to only 250 residents. The cinema, which is owned by a family who fought with the Nationalists, is still not visited by many families who stood with the Republicans.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nCatalonia\u2019s outspoken leader, Carles Puigdemont, continues to push for independence for the region. He has now called for mediation, which the Spanish government says is unacceptable. A Madrid source said to the BBC, \u201cmediation about what?\u201d\n\nPuigdemont has said that Catalonia will declare its independence from Spain within days, specifically, \u201c48 hours after all the official results are counted.\u201d\n\nWorrall notes that this will be a mostly symbolic act, but that the immediate repercussions for Spain are potentially drastic. Prime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status. Catalonia would then be governed by direct rule, which could possibly result in a deployment of troops to the region and the detainment of local politicians.\n\nThe fallout could spread throughout Europe, as other regional separatist movements may find reignited desires for independence, such as Scotland and the New Flemish Alliance in Belgium.\n\nView Images Many families had to abandon their horses over the last decade due to Spain's economic crisis.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer\n\nView Images The Sau Reservoir, which used to cover the former town of Sant Rom\u00e0 de Sau, was created in 1962 after a dam was built near the Ter River.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer", "description": "Decades of national tension lead to long-lasting implications for Spain's future.", "authors": "Austa Somvichian-Clausen", "top_image_url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/photography/PROOF/2017/October/rural-catalonia/02-rural-catalonia.jpg", "summary": "Photograph by Edu Bayer\u201cDuring the civil war Catalonia was the Republican fortress and stronghold, and it was from there that the battle against Fascism was launched,\u201d says Worrall.\n\u201cDuring the civil war, the use of our native language was repressed.\nPhotograph by Edu BayerBayer and Serena set out to capture the essence of rural Catalonian \u201cmicrovillages,\u201d each with less than 500 inhabitants.\nMicrocatalonia is a testament to the deep cuts created by the civil war, which are not yet healed.\nPrime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status.", "date": "2017-10-06T16:25:00Z"}, {"url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/ancient-ritual-pagan-sardinia-monsters.html", "title": "Inside an Ancient Pagan Ritual That Makes Men Become Monsters", "text": "Every Year, Men Turn Into Monsters for This Ancient Pagan Ritual Watch men from the small village of Mamoiada transform into the hideous beasts known as Mamuthones in this short film from the National Geographic Short Film Showcase.\n\nA mysterious, ancient tradition takes place each year in Mamoiada, a small village tucked into the middle of wild and mountainous Sardinia.

MIT physicist Rainer Weiss, co-winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics, was also born in Germany, joining the 35 percent of U.S. physics laureates who were born abroad.\n\nEvidence suggests that the globetrotting lifestyle itself spurs innovation. A study in Nature published October 4 suggests that scientists who moved around internationally are cited more widely than academics who stayed in the country where they published their first paper.\n\nOn average, today's science Nobel laureates are getting older.\n\nOf this year's laureates in medicine, physics, and chemistry, all but one are above the age of 70. That's reflective of a graying trend among laureates.

About a hundred years ago, there were only about a thousand physicists. Now, there are hundreds of thousands\u2014perhaps even a million\u2014worldwide, making the \u201cbreakthrough backlog\u201d that much larger with each passing year.\n\nThat said, novelists and economists have also grown in ranks, yet they aren't graying at the same rate as the sciences. In addition, the overall trend for the Nobel Peace Prize favors younger laureates. The Peace Prize claims the youngest-ever Nobel recipient: education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she co-won the prize in 2014.\n\nNobel laureates are overwhelmingly male.\n\nOut of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. In some disciplines, the drought has persisted for decades: The last woman to win a Nobel Prize for physics, Maria Goeppert Mayer, was honored in 1964. The gap reflects longtime institutional biases against women within the sciences, a lag exacerbated by the decades-long backlog of Nobel-worthy discoveries.\n\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains. Out of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. Male Organization Female 1901 Marie Curie Physics, 1903 Chemistry, 1911 Curie is the only woman who has been honored twice, for her studies about radiation.

They also say that the committee slightly bent prize rules to ensure that Marie Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics. But that may come as small consolation for the supremely qualified female scientists who were never recognized.\n\nFor instance, Lise Meitner, one of the co-discoverers of nuclear fission, was nominated for the physics prize 29 times from 1937 to 1965 and the chemistry prize an additional 19 times from 1924 to 1948, according to Nobel Foundation archival records. She never won. And while astronomer Vera Rubin's groundbreaking work revealing the existence of dark matter received wide acclaim, she died on December 25, 2016, with no Nobel to call her own. (Read National Geographic's obituary for Vera Rubin.)\n\nView Images Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist who studied nuclear fission, died in 1968. According to the official rules, Nobel Prizes can't be awarded after death.\n\nPhotograph by Corbis, Getty\n\nIncreasingly, Nobel laureates represent much larger scientific collaborations.\n\nNobel Foundation rules say that a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to up to three individuals, reflective of the small-team science that prevailed in the early 20th century. But today, major breakthroughs increasingly come from massive scientific collaborations, and the Nobel Committee has been reticent to award science prizes to broader groups.\n\nThe contrast is especially stark in physics, where scientific collaborations can include thousands of researchers\u2014as illustrated by the breakthrough that earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. The prize went to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish for detecting gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nWhile the trio's contributions were huge, they themselves argue that the prize should have recognized the broader LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which includes hundreds of scientists. After all, the study that announced the detection of gravitational waves has 1,011 co-authors, by Popular Science's count. Just 0.3 percent of them were honored by name in Stockholm.\n\n\"We live in an era where some huge discoveries are really the result of giant collaborations, with major contributions coming from very large numbers of people,\" Thorne says in an interview posted on the Nobel Prize's website.", "description": "We crunched the numbers on 115 years\u2019 worth of past prize winners, and the data revealed some striking trends.", "authors": "Michael Greshko", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/05/Lise-Meitner/OG-image-Lise-meitner-GettyImages-615290160.jpg", "summary": "Out of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates Organization While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.", "date": "2017-10-06T13:34:00Z"}, {"url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/lists/activities/best-museums-in-world.html", "title": "World's Best Museums", "text": "Journeys that spark the imagination can lead to revolutions in creativity.

Ideally, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to implement extreme solutions but for that not to happen things would have to be changed.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of people gathered across Spain earlier on Saturday as Catalonia prepared to declare independence from the rest of the country, many dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse Spain\u2019s worst political crisis for decades.\n\nThe Catalan authorities say around 90 percent of those who voted supported a split from Spain. Madrid says secession is illegal under the Spain\u2019s 1978 constitution. Residents of Catalonia who oppose secession largely boycotted the vote.\n\nThe crisis is a political test for Rajoy, who has been uncompromising. Some 900 people were injured during the vote when police tried to disrupt voting, firing rubber bullets and charging crowds with truncheons.\n\nThe political stand-off has divided the country, pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and shaken market confidence in the Spanish economy, prompting calls from the European Commission for Catalan and Spanish leaders to find a political solution.\n\n\u201cI hope that the Catalonia that makes pacts, is moderate and for many years contributed to Spain\u2019s economic growth and improvement in welfare and wealth returns.

From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.\n\n\u201cHe went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that\u2019s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the younger Mr. Paddock said. \u201cHe went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn\u2019t there either. He went to real estate and that\u2019s where the money was.\u201d\n\nStephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, \u201cwe had cash flow,\u201d said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,\u201d he said.\n\nWith success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.\n\n\u201cHe acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,\u201d said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.\n\nMr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and \u201cuppity about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cHe seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot\u2019s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.\n\n\u201cThis guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,\u201d said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.\n\nEven in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.\n\n\u201cIf Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cHe did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Most Boring\u2019 Son\n\nMr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.\n\n\u201cMy brother was the most boring one in the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said. \u201cHe was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it\u2019s like, who?\u201d\n\nTheir father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a \u201cglib, smooth talking \u2018confidence man,\u2019 who is egotistic and arrogant.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who \u201chas been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.\n\nThe boys\u2019 mother raised them alone on a secretary\u2019s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.\n\n\u201cShe kept that secret from the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said.\n\nStephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.\n\nMr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence. He didn\u2019t always stay between the lines.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.\n\n\u201cEverybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,\u201d Mr. Alarcon said. \u201cHe had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn\u2019t care what it took.\u201d\n\nA Knack for Making Money\n\nMr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not \u201cTaj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCrucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.\n\nHe was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants\u2019 complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.\n\nMr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. \u201cWhat you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.\n\n\u201cHe was frustrated by people who did stupid things,\u201d Mr. Franks said.\n\nHe was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.\n\nThough Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\n\n\u201cHe was a tough negotiator,\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cHe wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.\u201d\n\nThe House Advantage\n\nBy the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock\u2019s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe likes it when people go, \u2018Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?\u201d Eric Paddock said.\n\nGambling made him feel important, if not social.\n\n\u201cYou could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. \u201cHe liked everyone doting on him.\u201d\n\nHe sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.\n\nA couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock\u2019s gambling history.\n\nThe analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.\n\nPlaying a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.\n\nOne of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of \u201cGambling Wizards: Conversations With the World\u2019s Greatest Gamblers.\u201d A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often \u201clock\u201d a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.\n\nFor one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, \u201cbut he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Paddock \u201cknew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.\n\nHe was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Absent Neighbor\n\nMr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.\n\nColleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock\u2019s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.\n\nHe did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.\n\nWhen he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking. \u201cHe said nothing,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cNot a word. No eye contact.\u201d\n\nEven more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone has a reaction to Trump,\u201d said Mr. McKay\u2019s wife, Darlene.\n\nMs. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: \u201cHe always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock\u2019s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.\n\nIt is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.\n\nMr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.\n\nHis neighbors added personal touches to their yards \u2014 decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock\u2019s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.\n\nMs. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.\n\nSeveral days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.\n\nMs. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said.

Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O\u2019Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.\n\nIn a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I\u2019m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to \u201cdeal with this issue head on.\u201d\n\nI am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career.

But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, \u201cmy motto is to keep the peace.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d She said she had \u201cexplained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Ms. O\u2019Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women\u2019s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with \u201cvulnerable women who hope he will get them work.\u201d\n\nThe allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d to the television show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.\n\nIn 2015, the year Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem\u2019s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women\u2019s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, it seemed golden \u2014 the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,\u201d said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. \u201cBut behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s treatment of women.\n\nDozens of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.\n\nMr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its \u201cbusiness reputation\u201d or \u201cany employee\u2019s personal reputation,\u201d a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.\n\nCharles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not evidence of anything.\u201d\n\nI am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however.

But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the wake of Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein\u2019s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O\u2019Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.\n\n\u201cThe parties made peace very quickly,\u201d Ms. Bloom said.\n\nThrough her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O\u2019Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. \u201cI am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cBut remaining silent is causing me great distress.\u201d\n\nIn speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, \u201cWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it\u2019s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\u201d\n\nA Common Narrative\n\nMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein\u2019s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.\n\n\u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,\u201d one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. \u201cShe was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or skill set.\u201d The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management\u2019s attention through other employees.\n\nAcross the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPhoto\n\nWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing \u201cturndown duty\u201d late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.\n\nIn interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly \u2014 meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. \u201cIt was so manipulative,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou constantly question yourself \u2014 am I the one who is the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.\n\nMost women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.\n\nMs. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. \u201cWe were so young at the time,\u201d said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOthers in the London office said the same. \u201cI was pretty disturbed and angry,\u201d said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the way things were.\u201d\n\nThe human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. \u201cIf a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up\u201d so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.\n\nMany women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.\n\nBut in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern \u2014 young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels \u2014 have accumulated for almost three decades?\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret to the inner circle,\u201d said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein\u2019s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.\n\nSpeaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O\u2019Connor would be better off marrying a \u201cfat, rich Jewish\u201d man because she was probably just good for \u201cbeing a wife\u201d and \u201cmaking babies,\u201d she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.\n\nSteve Hutensky, one of Miramax\u2019s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.\n\nMs. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.\n\nMonths after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.\n\n\u2018Coercive Bargaining\u2019\n\nFor actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and popular attractions like the \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in \u201cChicago\u201d to Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cSilver Linings Playbook.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.\n\nMr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\u201d Ms. Judd said. \u201cIt was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.\u201d\n\nTo get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling \u201cpanicky, trapped,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.\u201d\n\nNot long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with \u201cVariety\u201d without naming the man involved.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was \u201cnot to be construed as an admission\u201d by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to \u201cavoid litigation and buy peace,\u201d according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film \u201cScream\u201d and would later star in the television show \u201cCharmed.\u201d She declined to comment.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nIncreased Scrutiny\n\nJust months before Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.\n\nSoon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.\n\nIn March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.\n\nThe claims were taken up by the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office later declined to bring charges.\n\nBut Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.\n\nMs. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.\n\nThen Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, \u201cThe balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.\u201d\n\nShe was a valued employee \u2014 Mr. Weinstein described her as \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201ca great person,\u201d \u201ca brilliant executive\u201d \u2014 so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O\u2019Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.\n\n\u201cBecause this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo.

Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller\u2019s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.\n\nNevertheless, the president\u2019s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.\n\n\u201cGood for them if they can pull it off,\u201d said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.\n\n\u201cMueller\u2019s not going to make a statement,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s not going to want to claw it back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.\n\nMr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to help Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.\n\nBut White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.\n\nOne sign of the White House\u2019s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.\n\nEven as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.\n\nBut lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.\n\nThe White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee\u2019s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.\n\nThat report could be finished before Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThey want them to write a report saying \u2018no collusion,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. \u201cAnd then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s aides, who once debated a scorched-earth strategy, hope the special counsel on Russia will give the president the public exoneration he has long sought.", "authors": "Matt Apuzzo and Michael S.

The independent studio is currently headed into a make-or-break period \u2014 Oscar season \u2014 without its master campaigner. In recent weeks, Mr. Weinstein had been personally working to re-edit \u201cThe Current War,\u201d a drama set for release in late November and intended as an anchor of the company\u2019s awards slate.\n\nAs it has become harder to make money with prestige-minded dramas, many of which now find their primary audiences through video on demand, the Weinstein Company has tried to pivot toward television production. But Mr. Weinstein\u2019s leave \u2014 not to mention an internal investigation and a board in disarray \u2014 may also curb those efforts, which include two major series in the works for Amazon Studios and three planned for Viacom\u2019s new Paramount channel.\n\nIn response to the news of the sexual harassment allegations, at least four Democratic senators said on Thursday that they would give away donations they had received from Mr. Weinstein, a supporter of several progressive causes. They were joined on Friday by Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nSome celebrities also reacted to the news, expressing frustration with the behavior described in the report while voicing support for the women who chose to speak out publicly.\n\nBut several actors, producers and directors contacted on Friday declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein and the relatively minimal public conversation in Hollywood about his behavior. One who did speak, Lynda Obst, a producer of films including \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d and \u201cThe Fisher King,\u201d said she expected more reactions to eventually surface.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think everyone is just taking it in, it\u2019s so upsetting \u2014 talking internally,\u201d Ms. Obst said. \u201cI do expect a robust response from the community rejecting this kind of behavior toward women.

The chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain took to Twitter to assail \u201call the people who knew and said nothing\u201d about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged harassment, as well as \u201cthose who are STILL staying silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNauseating, chicken-hearted enablers all,\u201d he called them.\n\nThe actress Kirstie Alley retweeted a message posted by the actor Peter Fonda in which Mr. Fonda said he would have insulted Mr. Weinstein to his face had he known about the alleged abuse.\n\nMr. Weinstein had supported endowments honoring women at both Rutgers University and the University of Southern California.\n\nRutgers said Friday that it planned to keep his financial contribution to the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture, and Feminist Studies, adding in a statement that the university \u201ccan think of no better use of this donation than to continue this important work.\u201d\n\nU.S.C. did not say whether the news would affect an endowment for female filmmakers that Mr. Weinstein had pledged to organize.\n\nIn the interview on Friday, Ms. Bloom said that she took issue with characterizations of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s actions as harassment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re using the term sexual harassment, which is a legal term,\u201d she told Mr. Stephanopoulos. \u201cSo, I\u2019m using the term workplace misconduct.

But the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, wanted to make one thing clear: Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t just teasing his favorite antagonists. He was sending a message.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that he\u2019s messing with the press,\u201d Ms. Sanders told reporters. \u201cI think we have some serious world issues here.

Maybe he was foreshadowing war with North Korea, which he has already threatened with \u201cfire and fury\u201d if the reclusive country aimed its missiles at the United States. Or perhaps he was predicting a clash with Iran, a week before he is expected to disavow the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to lay out his game plan for our enemies,\u201d Ms. Sanders declared.\n\nSometimes, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements leave his own staff in the dark, forcing them to impute a meaning to his words that might not actually exist. Privately, a few aides said they did not believe the president was preparing the country for war with either North Korea or Iran.\n\nBut they also noted Ms. Sanders has had a more successful debut as press secretary than her predecessor, Sean Spicer, in part because she has not attempted to clean up Mr. Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 something that would rankle the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d The Justice Department later said there was no evidence that Mr. Obama tapped his apartment during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPressed by reporters at the time, Mr. Spicer tried to walk back the claim, saying \u201cthe president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also shows an obvious delight in keeping people guessing. At the United Nations last month, he announced he had made up his mind about how to handle the Iran nuclear deal, but was not going to tell the public. When he met Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, perhaps America\u2019s closest ally, she asked him what he had decided. He refused to tell her, either.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say today he\u2019s made a decision,\u201d a bemused Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said at the time. \u201cI knew he had, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to say he had.\u201d\n\nHenry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is credited with coining the principle of constructive ambiguity in diplomacy: the use of deliberately fuzzy language to overcome sensitive issues in negotiations between countries. Mr. Trump may have tried a variation of that on Thursday evening, except that he was applying it to military deterrence.\n\nIn his prepared remarks to the military leaders, Mr. Trump outlined a series of specific challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have had challenges that we really should have taken care of a long time ago, like North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, ISIS and the revisionist powers that threaten our interests all around the world,\u201d the president said, using the an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nWhat made Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d particularly tantalizing was the timing.\n\nFor weeks, he has promised to retaliate against any North Korean aggression toward the United States. When Mr. Tillerson spoke in Beijing last week about seeking diplomatic channels to the North, Mr. Trump followed up with a tweet that his chief diplomat was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d the president\u2019s nickname for the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.\n\nMr. Trump also faces an Oct. 15 deadline to recertify the nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated among world powers during the Obama administration. He is expected to decline to recertify the agreement, which would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it is equally plausible that Mr. Trump was merely being theatrical, using the backdrop of military officers to stir up some drama. As the president spoke, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Paul J. Selva, stood next to him stoically.\n\nPerhaps it is not Mr. Kissinger, but his former boss, Richard M. Nixon, who is the president\u2019s model. Nixon devised the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of statecraft, under which he hoped to keep the nation\u2019s foes off balance by persuading them that he was impulsive and unpredictable.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Trump had adopted Nixon\u2019s keep-\u2018em-guessing approach, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, is the president trying to do that? Absolutely. I mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Trump, he seemed to savor the speculation. When a reporter asked him during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office what he meant by the \u201ccalm before the storm,\u201d he winked, paused, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d", "description": "With a wink and a smile, the president made ominous comments before a dinner with military leaders, but repeatedly refused to explain what he meant.", "authors": "Mark Landler", "top_image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/07/us/07dc-prexy/07dc-prexy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "summary": "As the generals shifted from foot to foot, Mr. Trump brought the game of 20 Questions to an end.\nMr. Trump may have tried a variation of that on Thursday evening, except that he was applying it to military deterrence.\nWhat made Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d particularly tantalizing was the timing.\nAsked whether Mr. Trump had adopted Nixon\u2019s keep-\u2018em-guessing approach, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, is the president trying to do that?\nI mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump, he seemed to savor the speculation.", "date": "2017-10-07T05:48:02Z"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/politics/trump-contraception-birth-control.html", "title": "Trump Administration Rolls Back Birth Control Mandate", "text": "The contraceptive coverage mandate, issued by the Obama administration under the Affordable Care Act, removed cost as a barrier to birth control, a longtime goal of advocates for women\u2019s rights.

Ryan of Wisconsin hailed the rules as \u201ca landmark day for religious liberty.\u201d The rules were also welcomed by groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns who had resisted the Obama administration\u2019s mandate because, they said, it would make them \u201cmorally complicit in grave sin.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe new administration isn\u2019t going to force Catholic nuns to provide contraceptives,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represents the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a long, divisive culture war because the last administration decided nuns needed to give out contraceptives.\u201d\n\nThe new initiatives came a day after Mr. Sessions changed the Justice Department\u2019s position on a related issue: whether a ban on workplace discrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 encompasses discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The Obama administration had adopted the view that it does cover transgender people, but Mr. Sessions said the department should take the position in court that it does not.\n\nMr. Sessions\u2019s guidance issued on Friday directs federal agencies to review their regulations with an eye to expanding their protections for religious believers. Conservative religious individuals and organizations have objected for years to nondiscrimination laws that have affected whom they can hire and fire, whom they can serve and how they can operate. The new directive affords them far broader latitude.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn issuing the new directive, Mr. Sessions reinterpreted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was adopted by Congress in 1993 with broad support from across the religious spectrum. It says the government could limit the free exercise of religion only if there was a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason, and must do so in the least restrictive way possible.\n\nAmong the possible results of the guidance, legal directors at liberal advocacy groups said, religious charities or schools that receive government funding could fire an unmarried employee who becomes pregnant, or an employee who marries a same-sex partner. Religious contractors that administer foster care programs could refuse to place foster children with gay couples, even in states that have nondiscrimination laws.\n\nHouses of worship that have been damaged in hurricanes could receive grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild \u2014 even if they are using the taxpayer funds to hire only staff members who share their religious beliefs, rather than making the positions open to all.\n\nIn addition, David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, said that clerks with the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs who do not agree with same-sex marriage could refuse, under this guidance, to process paperwork to provide benefits to a widow in a same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sweeping expansion of religious discrimination by the federal government, and we think it goes beyond where federal law is,\u201d he said.\n\nVanita Gupta, a top civil rights lawyer at the Justice Department during the Obama administration, said: \u201cThe freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it is not an absolute right. It cannot be used as a shield to permit discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, just as federal courts a half century ago denied the ability of businesses and employers to use their religious beliefs as a basis to discriminate against African-Americans.\u201d She also called the new contraception policy \u201ca direct attack on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said the new rules on contraception were \u201ca resounding victory for true-believing Americans.\u201d They will, she said, end the \u201cpersecution of ordinary Americans who for years have been seeking only the freedom to live in accordance with their faith, free from government interference.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Katskee, the legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group that plans to challenge the rules in court, said they imposed an impermissible burden on female employees who want cost-free contraceptive coverage and may be unable to get it.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is the right to believe and worship as you see fit,\u201d Mr. Katskee said. \u201cIt\u2019s never the right to use government to impose costs, burdens or harms on other people. You can\u2019t use the government to make other people pay the price for your religious beliefs or practices.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday also notified health insurance companies that it would vigorously enforce provisions of the Affordable Care Act regulating coverage of abortion services. The health department reminded insurers that if they cover abortion, they generally cannot use federal funds for that purpose, but must collect separate payments from consumers and must deposit the money in special accounts used exclusively for coverage of abortion services.\n\nUnder the new rules, exemptions to the contraceptive coverage mandate would be available to many kinds of employers, including publicly traded companies that said they had religious objections to covering some or all types of contraception.\n\nThe Trump administration said that some people would, as a result of the new rules, not receive \u201ccoverage or payments for contraceptive services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s legitimate interests in providing for contraceptive coverage do not require us to violate sincerely held religious beliefs\u201d or moral convictions, the administration said. But, it said, officials \u201cdo not have sufficient data to determine the actual effect of these rules,\u201d the extra costs that women might incur for contraceptives or the number of unintended pregnancies that might occur.", "description": "New rules vastly expand religious exemptions from an Obama-era requirement for employers to include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans.", "authors": "Robert Pear, Rebecca R.

In Britain, an anti-abortion member of Parliament named Jacob Rees-Mogg did not urge a mistress to end a pregnancy. Yay for him.

It\u2019s almost as if these men are fighting to make abortion a crime because they\u2019re more invested in curtailing women\u2019s options and controlling their bodies than they are with saving innocent lives.\n\nThe double standards employed by some members of the \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d Christian right are nothing new.

The congressman who voted for the Defense of Marriage Act was sexting with his underage male pages.\n\nScandals roll by so frequently that there is, by now, an expected script: the shocking revelation, the tearful confession, the up-from-the-ashes reinstatement plea or re-election campaign, garlanded with declarations of \u201cGod/my wife/Willie Robertson, star of \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 has forgiven me, why can\u2019t you?\u201d Perhaps the most shocking part of Mr. Murphy\u2019s story is that he elected to quit, rather than scream \u201cFake news!\u201d or sit back and wait for a new story to eclipse his hypocrisy, as Mr. DesJarlais did.\n\nBut what Mr. Murphy\u2019s moral flexibility ultimately reveals is that, for these particular hard-line anti-abortion politicians, it\u2019s not about fetal pain or the sanctity of life. It\u2019s all about control \u2014 whether you\u2019re telling a woman she can\u2019t have an abortion, or forcing a woman to get one.\n\nWhen Mr. Rees-Mogg was asked how he could oppose abortion as a lawmaker but support it as an investor, he told The Sunday Mirror, \u201cIt would be wrong to pretend that I like it, but the world is not always what you want it to be.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t we women know it.", "description": "Tim Murphy\u2019s \u201cpro-life in the streets, pro-choice in the sheets\u201d stance is just the latest example.", "authors": "Jennifer Weiner", "top_image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/opinion/08weiner/08weiner-facebookJumbo.jpg", "summary": "In 2015, Mr. DesJarlais voted in favor of a 20-week ban, and boasted of a \u201c100 percent pro-life voting record\u201d while in Congress.\nLike Mr. Murphy, he is a co-sponsor of the abortion bill that passed on Tuesday.\nIn Britain, an anti-abortion member of Parliament named Jacob Rees-Mogg did not urge a mistress to end a pregnancy.\nUnless the pregnancy is embarrassing and super-inconvenient and an impediment to your political future, in which case it\u2019s merely a clump of cells.\nIt\u2019s all about control \u2014 whether you\u2019re telling a woman she can\u2019t have an abortion, or forcing a woman to get one.", "date": "2017-10-07T12:09:12Z"}]
