This Sunday, Ferrari said it was a spark plug problem.\n\nIt became apparent on the grid, where there was fevered activity around Vettel's car. He started the race but immediately started losing places and complained of lacking power.\n\nHe was sixth after the first lap and stayed out during a safety-car period following a crash by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz - but after rapidly losing places again at the re-start after three laps was called into the pits a lap later.\n\nVettel told Sky: \"It's normal you're critical, especially if things go wrong, so it's part of our job.\n\n\"I think I need to protect them. We've done an incredible job so far. Bitter the past two races with the reliability issues - but you know, it's like that sometimes.\n\n\"Of course it hurts and we're all disappointed, but now we need to get back, get some rest and then go flat out for the last four races and see what happens.\"\n\n'Did you run here?' Three-time world champion Niki Lauda meets Sir Mo Farah\n\nA gift for Hamilton\n\nHamilton had gone into the race expecting a close fight with Vettel but the Ferrari driver's retirement left his closest rival as Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started fourth but passed team-mate Daniel Ricciardo into the first corner and Vettel into the Hairpin halfway around the first lap.\n\nThe Dutchman kept the pressure on Hamilton throughout the one-stop race and the gap was rarely more than three seconds.\n\nIn the closing laps, Hamilton began to complain of vibration from his engine and a lack of grip from his tyres following a virtual safety car period and Verstappen closed from three seconds behind to just over a second with two laps to go. But the Briton was able to hold him off as they negotiated backmarkers.\n\n\"I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap,\" said Hamilton. \"Ferrari have put on such a great challenge all season long. My team have done a great job. They are so meticulous and that is why we have the reliability we are having.\"\n\nAnother podium for Ricciardo\n\nRicciardo took a comfortable third - after fighting his way past Force India's Esteban Ocon after losing out to the Frenchman on the first lap - while Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas took fourth, moving up sixth on the grid after a five-place grid penalty for changing his gearbox.\n\nFerrari's scant consolation was fifth place for Kimi Raikkonen, who started 11th after a gearbox penalty, as Ocon and team-mate Sergio Perez took sixth and seventh ahead of Haas drivers Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.\n\nWilliams driver Felipe Massa held off a stern challenge from McLaren's Fernando Alonso for the final point, helped by a late virtual safety car. The Spaniard recovered well from the back of the grid following an engine penalty.\n\nJolyon Palmer finished 12th in his final race for the Renault team - he will be replaced by Sainz from the next race and the Briton may well have driven his final grand prix.\n\nDriver of the day\n\nVerstappen takes it for a brilliant start and first lap and keeping the pressure on Hamilton throughout - a shame that the Massa-Alonso battle prevented what could have been a tasty scrap for the win in the last two laps. An honourable mention for Alonso for a determined drive to 11th from the back of the grid in a car lacking power\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe US Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas is expected to be a Mercedes track - but a week later comes Mexico, where the world champions fear Ferrari will beat them.\n\nCan Ferrari salvage some self-respect after their season imploded in Asia and delay Hamilton's now apparently inevitable coronation - at least until the penultimate race in Brazil?\n\nJapanese F1 fans are some of the most dedicated, and unquestionably the most creative in the world\n\nWhat they said\n\nRace winner Lewis Hamilton: \"We have had such a great crowd this week you always look after us so well and the support was immense. I am grateful for that. The track was fantastic.\n\n\"The team did an incredible job. Max (Verstappen) had an outstanding race. It wasn't an easy one at all.\"\n\nSecond-placed Max Verstappen: \"It was a great day again. I really love the track. We had great pace - just really hard to pass.

It has been anticipated by industry officials and political observers in the days since the GOP repeal effort crashed.\n\nRepublicans have long contended that the insurance rules set by the 2010 health law, popularly dubbed Obamacare, have driven up premiums in the individual and small group markets, for healthier Americans especially. Democrats and supporters of the law typically counter that the rules have protected consumers from unwittingly buying shoddy products and helped subsidize the costs of sicker Americans.\n\nMr. Trump will order three agencies, the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, to take steps to make it easier for people to band together and buy insurance through \u201cassociation health plans,\u201d the official said.\n\nSuch plans would in some ways be like large employer\u2019s health plans, subject to some restrictions set by the Affordable Care Act, including a ban on lifetime limits. But they would be free of other regulations, including the requirement that insurance plans cover a set package of benefits. These plans are popular with conservatives; some insurers fear that associations would peel off healthier and younger individuals and leave traditional insurance plans to cover sicker and older customers.\n\nThe president also will order the agencies to start winding back an Obama-era rule curbing coverage known as \u201cshort-term medical insurance,\u201d a low-cost but limited-protection option, and allow people to once again buy those plans for up to a year, the official said.\n\nThe Obama administration banned the sale of those plans that offered coverage for more than 90 days, arguing they were inadequate for people\u2019s needs. Some industry officials have pressed the administration to restore them, saying that when marketed honestly they can fit the needs of particular consumers currently priced out of buying the more generous coverage available as a result of the 2010 health-care overhaul.\n\nIn addition, the executive order would order agencies to expand health reimbursement accounts, employer-funded arrangements that employees can use to pay out-of-pocket medical costs and premiums. Obama-era guidance from 2013 had prevented pretax employer dollars in the arrangements from being used to buy health insurance on the individual market.\n\nThe three moves would represent the most substantive step the White House has taken to date in paring back Affordable Care Act rules using administrative powers. They don\u2019t go as far as many critics of the law would like but are likely to be followed by other steps, administration officials said.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump has signaled that he is interested in working with Democrats to pass a bipartisan health-care deal, and Democrats have responded by proposing their own preferred measures to shore up rickety health-insurance markets, in which rising premiums have hit many of the same people targeted by the executive order.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) a day earlier to discuss renewing efforts to pass health-care legislation.\n\nLater Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters as he traveled to North Carolina that he was willing to cut a short-term deal with Democrats to save the health law from collapsing, but \u201cit\u2019s really up to them. [The Affordable Care Act is] exploding, like I said it would.\u201d\n\nBut parts of the order may prove contentious enough to undo that effort\u2014chiefly, its directive to the Labor Department to spur the sale of insurance across state lines through the use of association health plans. Health analysts and industry officials also said some of the regulatory changes, once completed, could prompt legal challenges.\n\nThe department would likely make changes that effectively expand the scope of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, which governs the plans operated by large employers with workers in different states. Ahead of the release of the rule, the department had already been examining the law, according to people familiar with the deliberations. In addition, the Treasury Department has been exploring changes to the rules governing health-reimbursement accounts, industry officials said.\n\nThe idea of coverage sold across state lines has long been championed by Republicans, who say it is the most effective way to foster competition, particularly in parts of the country where people buying coverage on their own currently have only one insurer selling plans.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), said he had been pushing the idea with the administration.\n\n\u201cHe has been working with President Donald Trump on this proposal for several months, and we believe it will directly result in giving the American people more options to find low-cost and high-quality health care options,\u201d said Sergio Gor, the spokesman.\n\nDemocrats have characterized the effort as potentially sabotaging the consumer protections they set in the ACA, and they have won support from some insurance industry officials. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has said it has concerns.\n\nSome industry officials say that siphoning off healthier individuals from the existing insurance markets with the promise of skimpier benefits but lower premiums could further undermine those markets, increasing premiums ever more for the sicker, costlier enrollees that remain.\n\n\u201cIts aim is clearly to do with the pen what Congress wouldn\u2019t\u2014eliminate pre-existing condition protections, essential benefit protections and lifetime caps and turn the ACA into a sparsely available high-risk pool,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, who was the Obama administration\u2019s top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nMr. Trump pledged he would issue the order the day after Senate Republicans decided last month that they didn\u2019t have enough support to pass a repeal proposal led by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, ending GOP efforts for now to roll back the ACA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being finished now,\u201d Mr. Trump said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people.

More than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\n\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\n\n\"Two principal factors affect the size and strength of bores \u2026 the magnitude of the tidal range and the shape of the river at its estuary,\u201d said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at California's San Diego State University, in a 2005 interview with National Geographic.\n\nBarring extreme weather conditions, bores form only when a river\u2019s mouth is shallow, uniform, and resembles a funnel. Bore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\n\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver. As it encounters shallow water, the crest of the wave moves faster than its trough, sharpening its peak. Eventually, the wave breaks\u2014and a bore is born.\n\nSome tidal bores have global reputations for their beauty and destructive power. Each year, the U.K.\u2019s Severn River sees some 250 bores move upriver. The Lupar Benak bore in Sarawak, Malaysia, nearly drowned the British author Somerset Maugham during a 1949 visit. And as National Geographic reported in 2005, some bores in the Amazon have become tourist attractions, as thrill-seeking surfers try to ride them upriver.\n\nBut no bore is as well-known, or as large, as the Qiantang tidal bore, locally known as the \u201cSilver Dragon.\u201d Records for this tidal bore, which can be up to nine feet tall and travel up to 25 miles an hour, go back nearly 3,000 years. These records include some of the oldest written tide tables recovered in China.\n\nThe estuary\u2019s structure is textbook bore material. The Hangzhou Bay, into which the Qiantang river empties, is more than 60 miles across at its mouth, but it narrows to a gap less than 13 miles across where it meets the Qiantang. As high tides enter the bay, they\u2019re funneled in toward the river's mouth, spawning massive high tides and especially strong tidal bores.\n\nThese walls of water pack extraordinary power. Over the years, the Qiantang\u2019s bores have constructed a massive complex of sandbars with an estimated total volume of 42.5 billion cubic meters. That\u2019s enough sand to fill a box 2.6 miles to a side.", "summary": "On This River, the Moon Fights Earth's Gravity and WinsOn October 6, more than a hundred thousand tourists gathered on the banks of China\u2019s Qiantang river to witness an extraordinary sight: a wall of water several feet tall racing its way upriver.\nMore than 80 rivers around the world have tidal bores, according to one widely-cited 1988 catalog.\nWhat creates a tidal bore?\nBore-bearing rivers also need to experience large swings in water level between high tide and low tide in their estuaries, where the river and sea meet and mix.\nAs high tide rolls into one of these bore-prone estuaries, the influx of water becomes more confined as it moves upriver.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "This Woman Saved the Americas From the Nazis", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker-nazi-spy-fagone.html", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/07/booktalk-code-friedman/elizebeth-and-william-F-098.jpg", "date": "2017-10-07T04:01:00Z", "description": "Pioneering codebreaker Elizebeth Friedman, a poet and mother of two, smashed spy rings by solving secret messages.", "authors": "Simon Worrall", "text": "View Images Elizebeth Friedman, here with her husband William, learned to crack codes when she took a job with an eccentric millionaire who was obsessed with Shakespeare.\n\nPhotograph Courtesy of the George C. Marshall Foundation, Lexington, Virginia.\n\nView Images Courtesy of HarperCollins\n\nElizebeth Friedman is probably not a name familiar to most of our readers. Introduce us to this remarkable woman\u2014and explain what drew you to her.\n\nWell, it\u2019s an amazing American story. A hundred years ago, a young woman in her early twenties became one of the greatest codebreakers America had ever seen. She taught herself how to solve secret messages without knowing the key. That\u2019s codebreaking. And she started from absolutely nothing.\n\nShe wasn't a mathematician. She was a poet. But she turned out to be a genius at solving these very difficult puzzles, and her solutions changed the 20th century. She caught gangsters and organized-crime kingpins during Prohibition. She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\n\nShe also helped to invent the modern science of secret writing\u2014cryptology\u2014that lies at the base of everything from government institutions like the NSA to the fluctuations of our daily online lives. Not bad for a Quaker girl from a small Indiana town! [Laughs]\n\nWe first meet Elizebeth at a mansion named Riverbank near Chicago that belonged to a notorious millionaire named George Fabyan. Paint a picture of this larger-than-life man\u2014and explain his obsession with Shakespeare.\n\nFabyan was a lot like William Randolph Hearst or Andrew Carnegie\u2014one of these incredibly wealthy Gilded Age multimillionaires who\u2019d made his fortune in the textiles industry. Unlike a lot of other Gilded Age rich men, Fabyan didn\u2019t go for lavish vacations on the French Riviera or collect art. He dreamed of discovering the secrets of nature. Although he was a high school drop-out, he saw himself as a great sponsor of science, somebody who used his fortune to bring together some of America\u2019s finest scientists and give them carte blanche to discover the secrets of the world.\n\nHe was very eccentric. He lived in a villa full of furniture that hung from the ceiling on chains. His couch and bed hung on chains. He was extremely suspicious of everyone around him. He kept a hive of honeybees inside his own personal house because he didn\u2019t trust them to make honey unless he surveilled them personally. [Laughs]\n\nOne of his obsessions was secret writing. He believed that Shakespeare wasn\u2019t the author of the famous plays, like Hamlet and Julius Caesar. He thought that they were written by one of Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries, the philosopher Francis Bacon.\n\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature. To do that he hired some of the world\u2019s most prominent Bacon and Shakespeare experts and brought them to Riverbank. That\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\n\nRelated: How Three Men You Probably Never Heard of Helped End WWII The British sailors boarded a sinking German U-boat, recovering vital Nazi documents and secret codebooks. This short animation by Mike Brookes is part of the Short Film Showcase. The filmmakers created the content presented, and the opinions expressed are their own, not those of National Geographic Partners.\n\nElizebeth cut her teeth as a codebreaker during Prohibition in the unlikely role of interdicting rumrunners. Set the scene for us\u2014and describe how she reacted to becoming a minor celebrity.\n\nAfter she left Riverbank in 1921, she moved to Washington and was soon recruited by the U.S. Treasury Department to fight illegal liquor smuggling that had grown because of Prohibition. Rumrunners used ships that could outrun the Coast Guard vessels to smuggle rum into the U.S. The Coast Guard was unable to stop them because the rumrunners got good at concealing their operations using coded radio messages. Thousands of these messages were piling up in the Coast Guard offices so they approached Elizebeth Friedman to get help reading them.\n\nBetween 1926-1930, she solved 20,000 smuggling messages per year in hundreds of different code systems. She did it all by hand with pencil and paper, before the era of computers. It was analog heroism.\n\nToward the end of the 1920s, she also began to testify in court against some of the biggest gangsters of the day. These criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages. She would go into court carrying her handbag, wearing a pink dress and hat with flower pins, and would explain to a jury exactly how she had intercepted these radio messages and decoded them.\n\nSome of these guys were very dangerous. She testified in one case in New Orleans against three lieutenants of Al Capone.\n\nAs a result, she became one of the most famous codebreakers in the world. She was known as the Lady Manhunter, or the Key Woman of the Keyman, \u201ckeyman\u201d being a nickname for a treasury agent, similar to G-Man in the FBI. She was on front pages from coast to coast and she hated all of it! [Laughs] She was a very modest person, and disdained what she later called the hero worship.\n\nThe publicity also created problems because codebreaking is normally a secret profession. You are revealing the secrets of people who are communicating secretly and the more you reveal about how you found those secrets, the easier you make it for people to conceal their future communications.\n\nView Images Elizebeth Friedman met Ian Fleming in the course of her intelligence work. He went on to write the James Bond novels.\n\nPhotograph by M. McKeown/Express/Getty\n\nToday, most codebreaking is done by computers. What sort of methods did Elizebeth have at her disposal?\n\nGreat question! She did everything with pencil and paper and a series of techniques, some of which had been around for hundreds of years and some she had to invent herself. Working with William Friedman, who later became her husband, in the early days of Riverbank, she created different approaches and attacks on secret messages that allowed her to pick apart garbled blocks of letters and arrange them into patterns that made sense.\n\nOver decades of practice, solving tens of thousands of messages every year, she developed an intuition, a way of thinking that made her one of the best in the world at seeing the shapes of words in a field of letters that nobody else could make sense of.\n\nHer achievements reached their peak in World War II in what came to be known as the \u201cinvisible war.\u201d Take us inside this murky world of espionage and counterintelligence.\n\nAfter Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and World War II began, the codebreaking team Elizabeth had built within the Coast Guard started to intercept and analyze messages that looked a lot like rumrunning messages but were actually being sent by Nazi spies. These spies were spreading into South America, which was a neutral continent then, and into the U.S. and Mexico. All of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.\n\nIn the process, she met figures from British intelligence. The British sent over a lot of young officers, who looked to all the world like they were just British chaps having a good time, but were actually spies. One was Ian Fleming, who would go on to write the James Bond novels. Another was a young Roald Dahl, who at that time was a handsome pilot in the RAF.\n\nShe also worked on the notorious Enigma codes. While Alan Turing was organizing large-scale attacks on enigma codes using algorithms and large electromechanical devices called bombes, Elizebeth was more narrowly focused on a couple of Enigma\u2019s systems being used by Nazi spies. That\u2019s how the notorious SS spy Johannes Siegfried Becker, nicknamed \u201cSargo,\u201d was encrypting reports he sent back from South America to Berlin.\n\nThe FBI considered Becker the most dangerous Nazi spy in the Western Hemisphere. He directed more than 50 agents from a base in Argentina, exchanging thousands of sensitive espionage reports with Germany, gathering information on U.S. and British military capabilities and instigating military coups in South American countries to swing governments toward the Nazis. Elizebeth\u2019s efforts led to the destruction of every Nazi spy network in South America, in particular the one run by \u201cSargo.\u201d\n\nYou write that, \u201cby any measure, Elizebeth was a great heroine of the Second World War.\u201d But her role was erased by J. Edgar Hoover. Explain what happened.\n\nThe FBI had responsibility for catching Nazi spies in South America and those were the networks that Elizebeth was tracking. So she was giving messages to the FBI and also providing them with materials so they could solve messages themselves. Without Elizebeth and her team, the FBI would have been completely lost.\n\nBut after the networks were destroyed toward the end of 1944, J. Edgar Hoover launched a publicity campaign to take credit for winning this invisible war, claiming that the FBI was solely responsible. He produced a film that was shown to U.S. troops called \u201cThe Battle of the United States,\u201d which portrayed the FBI as the main hero, and published articles in popular magazines about the FBI\u2019s great work. He did not credit Elizebeth or her team.\n\nTo this day historians wrongly praise Hoover and the FBI for achievements that were actually Elizebeth\u2019s. As a result, Americans have no idea that Elizebeth Friedman, a mother of two, was the great Nazi spy catcher of the war.\n\nThe National Security Agency hit the headlines with whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Describe the Friedmans role in its creation in 1952.\n\nElizabeth and William are the Adam and Eve of the NSA in the sense that they were present at the birth of U.S. codebreaking at Riverbank in 1916. Everything that happened afterward grew out of that time and place. Elizebeth also helped to invent the science that undergirds a lot of the NSA\u2019s work. But she had no direct role in the NSA\u2019s creation. It was her husband, William Friedman, who helped create it.\n\nThe Army codebreaking unit that William launched in the early 1930s, and led all through the war, decrypted Japanese cypher machines, leading to major U.S. victories. After the war that unit became absorbed into the agency that we now know as the NSA.\n\nWilliam was an NSA official for a number of years, until he began to believe that the NSA was collecting too much information and keeping too much of it classified. He became suspicious about the direction of an institution that, in many ways, he helped create, and eventually came to believe that the NSA\u2019s practices were a threat to democracy itself. In private letters, he made criticisms of the NSA that are reminiscent of Edward Snowden\u2019s criticisms decades later.\n\nYou write, \u201cThe world forgot about her and remembered him.\u201d Why do you think this was?\n\nSexism? [Laughs] Part of the reason she was forgotten after the war is because of secrecy. Her records were classified, stamped \u201cTop Secret Ultra,\u201d and carried off to what she called \u201cgovernment tombs.\u201d Thousands of pages of her decryptions and proof of everything she had done in the war were placed under lock and key in the National Archives until as late as the year 2000.\n\nAlong with many other American women who wrote codes during the war, she was told that if she ever spoke about it, even to her grandchildren, she would be prosecuted. So she didn\u2019t. As a result, for many years nobody knew what she had done in the war.\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.", "summary": "She hunted Nazi spies during World War II.\nFabyan believed Bacon had placed secret messages inside the original 1623 edition of the plays as a signature of his authorship and was convinced these secret messages could be discovered, thereby rewriting the history of English literature.\nThat\u2019s how Elizebeth Friedman, then Elizebeth Smith, ended up at Riverbank at the age of 23 as a codebreaker.\nThese criminal cases required her to explain to juries how she had solved these secret messages.\nAll of a sudden, Elizebeth\u2019s team, which had been focused on smuggling, became a team that hunted Nazi spies.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "This Bug's Penis Is a Built-In Violin", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/animals-anatomy-sound-communication.html", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/07/waq-animal-sounds/05-waq-animal-sounds-NationalGeographic_1235480.jpg", "date": "2017-10-07T04:00:00Z", "description": "Get the why and how behind the sounds of the water boatman, sperm whales, and other noisy animals.", "authors": "Liz Langley", "text": "View Images The water boatman can make quite a racket with its anatomy.\n\nPhotograph by Ingo Arndt, Minden Pictures, National Geographic Creative\n\nHow do you play a built-in trumpet?\n\nWhen a friend asked, \u201cDo elephants make that trumpeting sound through their nose or mouth?\u201d that prompted us to take a deeper look at how animals make some of their unique sounds.\n\nElephants\n\n\u201cMostly the trumpeting sound is made with the trunk only,\u201d among the African forest elephants studied at Cornell University\u2019s Elephant Listening Project says project director Peter Wrege via email.\n\nView Images Elephants like this African forest elephant make trumpeting sounds when they are excited, fearful, or happy.\n\nPhotograph by Carlton Ward, National Geographic Creative\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca bit like sounds we make by blowing air forcefully through mostly closed lips,\u201d though sometimes they add \u201ca bit of a \u2018voice.\u2019\u201d (Related: What Elephant Calls Mean: A User\u2019s Guide)\n\n\u201cTry it,\u201d Wrege suggests, \u201cbut be careful where.\u201d\n\nWrege thinks all of the sound, \u201cincluding the components added by the vocal fold vibration,\u201d is emitted from the end of the trunk\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be surprising, he says, if the mouth is involved in producing the trumpets as well, depending on the emotional state of the elephant.\n\nWrege says elephants make this sound \u201cin times of high excitement, fear, or happiness,\u201d among this species, and we can see why.

That air opens and closes a membrane that makes clicking sounds.\n\nWhales also use two oil-filled tubes, the spermaceti organ, which bounces sound off the back of the head and the junk, a segmented tube in the front of the head.\n\nThose segments in the junk \u201chelp to directionalize the sound,\u201d so it comes out in a loud, well-aimed beam.

Here's what you need to know about Hurricane Nate 2017 and other potentially powerful storms:\n\nNATE'S PATH\n\nTropical Depression 19 became Tropical Storm Nate Thursday, when it savaged parts of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, killing at least 21 people there. As of Friday afternoon, the storm was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nForecasters predict the eye of the storm could hit just east of New Orleans by Saturday night or early Sunday, making it the third hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in six weeks. Hurricane warnings were announced for much of the northern Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nThe storm is likely to miss the areas most hard-hit by other recent hurricanes, from Puerto Rico to Houston. Still, there could be substantial damage and risk to life, if the storm continues to strengthen. (Read about how to survive in a natural disaster.)\n\nROLE OF WARMER WATER\n\nWaters over the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean remain very warm, a condition that helps hurricanes draw strength, upping wind speeds. Due to that warmth, this hurricane season was predicted to be more active than average.\n\n\"In short: atmospheric conditions [are] hurricane-friendly, and surface sea temperatures were warmer than usual,\" Michael Greshko reported for us recently.\n\n\"The Climate Prediction Center says that multiple conditions, such as a strong west African monsoon, have aligned to make the Caribbean Sea and part of the tropical Atlantic\u2014a storm-spawning area called the 'Main Development Region'\u2014particularly well-suited to hurricanes,\" Greshko wrote.\n\nAnd while scientists maintain that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change, two centuries of human fossil-fuel burning has altered temperatures just enough to almost certainly make this season's storms more powerful.\n\n\"In general, the way to think about it is: climate change has changed the environment that everything is happening in,\" Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, told National Geographic's Craig Welch. \"When you add in the climate's natural variability and then the right conditions come along, you can get a storm which is stronger than you might otherwise have expected.\"\n\nHOW HURRICANES WORK\n\nHurricanes form by drawing energy from warm ocean water and converting it into the mechanical energy of wind. Those that form in the Atlantic Basin\u2014which includes the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea\u2014are often spawned by late-summer thunderstorms that roll off the west coast of Africa near the Cabo Verde Islands.\n\nDue to the Earth's rotation, Atlantic hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise. They are one form of tropical cyclone, which also forms in the Pacific Ocean. In the western Pacific, these same storms are known as typhoons. However, storms that form in the Southern Hemisphere rotate clockwise. (See \"Typhoon, Hurricane, Cyclone: What's the Difference?\")\n\nAs hurricanes form, they can be slowed, weakened, or even stopped if they pass over cool enough water, if their updraft is blocked by upper-level winds, or if too much wind shear breaks them up.

They were imported from their native range by people\u2014in the case of the hippos, by the now-deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose private zoo the beasts escaped from.\n\nThe conventional view among ecologists is that these species and other expatriate herbivores are an ecological problem. A new study takes issue with that, arguing that we should welcome them in their new ranges. According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\n\nOf the 76 herbivores in the world that weigh more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds), 22 have substantial populations outside their native ranges, according to ecologist Erick Lundgren of Arizona State University and his colleagues. Of those 22, half are threatened or extinct in their native ranges.\n\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species. The aurochs that humans once painted on caves, for example, and later domesticated into modern cattle, is long since extinct\u2014but feral cattle run wild from Hawaii to Hong Kong.\n\nThough every population has its own story\u2014Pablo Escobar used his hippos to show off\u2014there are common themes. \u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\n\nDrug Kingpin Pablo Escobar\u2019s Hippos Are Alive and Well\n\nThe question now is how to think and what to do about them. Lundgren and co-author Arian Wallach, an ecologist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, say these animals are often bringing grazing back to landscapes where it has been missing. By grazing tree seedlings, large herbivores keep grasslands from turning into forest and reduce fire risk. By grazing in one place and pooping in another, they move nutrients around.\n\nIn Arizona Lundgren has even watched wild burros\u2014whose ancestors hail from North Africa\u2014dig water holes that are then used by coyotes, javelinas, bighorn sheep, and plants. But to a lot of Arizonans these days, the burros are pests that amble around town as if they own the place, and wreck cars by allowing themselves to get hit.\n\nThey Can\u2019t Go Home Again\n\nMany conservationists have argued that such wayward animals should be \u201cput back\u201d in their native habitats. But that often isn\u2019t possible, Wallach says. The one-humped dromedary camel is an example.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why these animals went extinct in the Middle East in the first place,\u201d she says. Wild camels were presumably hunted and domesticated out of existence, and today there\u2019s no obvious place in the Middle East or North Africa where they\u2019d be safe for a massive reintroduction effort. Besides, Wallach points out, although we tend to think that the dromedary \u201cbelongs\u201d in the Middle East\u2014because that is where humans first encountered and domesticated it\u2014the species actually evolved millions of years earlier in North America.\n\nToday, Wallach says, \u201ccamels are best suited to Australia,\u201d where they were introduced in the 19th century, and where there are now some 300,000 dromedaries wandering in the desert. Part of the reason she and her colleagues conducted their survey was to get people to realize that these non-native populations are often large and ecologically influential.\n\nWallach got the idea while looking at a map created by co-author William Ripple, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The map showed where large herbivores live on Earth, but Australia was completely empty\u2014despite the fact that, in addition to the world\u2019s only population of wild dromedaries, it currently hosts seven other introduced species of large herbivore, including donkeys, water buffalo, horses, the endangered banteng from Southeast Asia, and the vulnerable sambar deer, from India.\n\nBecause they aren\u2019t native, they weren\u2019t on Ripple\u2019s original map. This selective vision is widespread in ecology, and in practice it means that little is known about these populations. Even now, with the study complete, Lundgren is hearing about new populations with some regularity. \u201cI just found a new species that we missed,\u201d he says. \u201cGiant eland in Cuba. There\u2019s like 1,000.\u201d This uncommonly beautiful antelope is vulnerable to extinction in its native Africa.\n\n\u201cThese animals exist,\u201d says Lundgren. \u201cFor many of them the introduced home is the home they know more than anywhere else. We would spend a great deal of energy and time killing these animals if we were to try to go back to some pure historic baseline.\u201d Instead, he thinks it better to \u201copen our eyes to a wonder that we so often ignore and celebrate these animals.\u201d\n\nCelebrate Camels? Please.\n\nOther ecologists are not yet breaking out the champagne. Daniel Simberloff of the University of Tennessee studies the impact of non-native species on ecosystems, and he says Lundgren and his colleagues have unfairly stacked the deck, reporting only the positive impacts of the invasive herbivores and ignoring the problems they cause.\n\n\u201cCamels, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Simberloff says. \u201cThere is an entire book and many papers about the many inimical impacts\u2014ecological as well as economic and social, of feral camels.\u201d Indeed, studies suggest that the desert wanderers damage and foul water holes and springs, including those that have cultural significance to Aboriginal people. The taciturn beasts have also locally wiped out tasty plants such as the quandong, a delicious fruit in the sandalwood family.\n\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under. But \u201cthey don\u2019t have to roam over half of Australia.\u201d\n\nView Images Wild horses\u2014these are in the McCullough Peaks Herd Management Area near Cody, Wyoming\u2014are a contentious issue in the American West.\n\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic Creative\n\nOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory. But they say the devil is\u2014as always in ecology\u2014in the details. Eric Beever, a United States Geological Survey ecologist based in Bozeman, Montana, says that while some grazing on a landscape might be great, too much can reduce the diversity of other flora and fauna, from small mammals to plants. Without predators keeping these out-of-place herbivores in check, species like wild horses can becomes a real problem in the American West.\n\n\u201cI love riding horses,\u201d Beever says. \u201cIn a romantic sense it is a beautiful thing to watch them; from an ecologist\u2019s perspective\u2026.\u201d he trails off, then quotes ecologist Aldo Leopold. \u201cOne of the penalties of an ecological education,\u201d Leopold once wrote, \u201cis that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen.\u201d For Beever, the intensive grazing of wild horses\u2014though it\u2019s far outweighed by the impact of domestic cattle\u2014is one such wound.\n\nWallach, who isn\u2019t a layperson, doesn\u2019t see it that way. The landscape that so many ecologists associate with natural health in western North America isn\u2019t natural, she says. It was actually created by the extinction, starting more than 10,000 years ago, of the many large animals that lived in North America during the Pleistocene ice ages. Human hunters were the main culprit, and the result was a greener, woodsier world with less grazing in it.\n\n\u201cThe concept of \u2018overgrazing\u2019 tells us about ourselves,\u201d Wallach says. \u201cWhen one says animals are overgrazing, one is really saying \u2018I feel that this landscape has a grazing impact that I don\u2019t like.\u2019\u201d\n\nNext: Invasive Elephants?\n\nCornell ecologist Harry Greene, for one, is willing to go beyond celebrating the herbivores we\u2019ve already introduced. He thinks we should consider introducing more, as proxies for the Pleistocene animals that went extinct.\n\nNorth America used to host a lot of mammoths, and burros, wild horses, and cattle don\u2019t exactly replace these enormous browsers. Elephants might, though\u2014and Greene proposes we do an experiment to see how they would interact with a modern American ecosystem. \u201cWe have over 100 Asian elephants in the country now, and there is increasing sentiment to get them out of zoos,\u201d he says. Why not create a controlled herd, behind fences, and study them?\n\nThreatened by habitat loss and poaching in Africa and Asia, elephants might one day, in this view, find refuge in America. \u201cIf the only elephants left on earth were a North American herd that started with zoo animals, that would still be better than no elephants left on Earth at all,\u201d Greene says.", "summary": "According to the authors, out-of-place beasts are either replacing grazing animals that humans drove extinct thousands of years ago, or preserving their own species from extinction, or both.\nSome of the new populations are feral, that is, they\u2019re wild now but are descended from domesticated versions of extinct species.\n\u201cEither they are beasts of burden that became replaced by automobiles, or they were introduced for hunting for meat or sport,\u201d Lundgren says.\nGiven the extinction of wild camels in Arabia, Simberloff says, a carefully managed conservation herd could be kept Down Under.\nPhotograph by Bob Smith, National Geographic CreativeOther researchers like the idea of taking another look at invasive populations, in theory.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "Largest Marine Protected Area in North America Created off Mexico", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/mexico-revillagigedo-oceans-pristine-seas-conservation-environment-spd.html", "top_image_url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/10/06/pristine_seas_mexico/3-pristine-seas-San-Benedicto-UW-417.jpg", "date": "2017-10-06T16:25:00Z", "description": "The Revillagigedo marine reserve protects a vast area in the Pacific and is home to many sharks, rays, and other life.", "authors": "Brian Clark Howard, Michael Greshko", "text": "These Giant Manta Rays Just Want to Hang Out\n\nThe Mexican government has announced the creation of a new marine reserve in the Pacific Ocean Thursday, the largest protected area of its kind in North America.\n\nAlejandro Del Mazo Maza, representing Mexico\u2019s National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, announced the massive expansion of the Revillagigedo marine park on October 5 at the Our Ocean conference in Malta.\n\nThe park covers more than 57,000 square miles, a vast rectangle of ocean encompassing the four Revillagigedo Islands, small volcanic landmasses under Mexico's control that lie about 240 miles southwest of Baja California.

He also said that Mexico will not permit the construction of hotel facilities on the islands.\n\nPreviously, the islands had been protected by a small reserve that included only the waters up to six miles off the land. That left important feeding and migration areas for sharks, rays, whales, and other species in the path of fishermen\u2014who either target the species, often illegally, or catch them accidentally as bycatch.\n\nBut the new park is designed to protect critical habitat for those animals, as well as corals and other fish. No fishing, mining, or other intensive resource development will be allowed in the newly expanded reserve.\n\n'Giant Manta Rays Galore'\n\n\"This is the wildest place in tropical North America,\" says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas fact-finding expedition to the area in March 2016. \"It\u2019s one of the places where you can see the most giant manta rays and sharks on the planet.\"\n\nDuring the expedition, the team of more than a dozen scientists saw \"giant manta rays galore,\" says Sala. \"We saw lots of sharks, groupers, and tuna. It was a rare place of large fish, with biodiversity as if the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands had opened a branch in Mexico.\"\n\nOn land, the islands are home to many sea and land birds, endemic reptiles, and unique plants.\n\nWith a DeepSee submersible and remote dropcams, the Pristine Seas team also surveyed a ridge about 300 feet beneath the surface. There, they found \"a beautiful soft coral garden,\" says Sala, packed with corals, sea fans, sponges, crabs, and fish.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nWhen proposed, the reserve saw some opposition from fishermen, but fishing fleets used only a small part of the waters, says Sala. Of the entire Pacific range fished by Mexico's tuna fleet, only seven percent of their effort was directed in the waters of the newly expanded reserve, he says.\n\nAnd what's more, Mexico's fishermen should see their catches in waters outside the reserve increase, says Sala, due to spill-over of growing fish populations in the protected waters. That's exactly what happened around the Gal\u00e1pagos after fishing was restricted in 1998, turning former adversaries of the reserve into supporters.\n\nThe reserve should also increase the amount of dive tourism to the area, which is already a $15 million business. Boats often leave out of the popular resort destination Cabo San Lucas, a few hundred miles away.\n\nEach living manta ray is worth 57 times more to Mexico's economy through increased tourism than the money received by selling its body parts to Asia, Sala's team calculated.\n\nThe next step will be enforcement of the reserve's new boundaries. Illegal fishermen have been operating there with sophistication, sometimes using helicopters to spot for enforcement vessels.\n\nThe reserve is the newest marine park that Sala and his Pristine Seas initiative at National Geographic helped bring into being.

Small villages continue to stand divided from stances taken during the war. For example, one of the oldest cinemas in Spain is located in the small village of Caseres, home to only 250 residents. The cinema, which is owned by a family who fought with the Nationalists, is still not visited by many families who stood with the Republicans.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nCatalonia\u2019s outspoken leader, Carles Puigdemont, continues to push for independence for the region. He has now called for mediation, which the Spanish government says is unacceptable.

Prime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status. Catalonia would then be governed by direct rule, which could possibly result in a deployment of troops to the region and the detainment of local politicians.\n\nThe fallout could spread throughout Europe, as other regional separatist movements may find reignited desires for independence, such as Scotland and the New Flemish Alliance in Belgium.\n\nView Images Many families had to abandon their horses over the last decade due to Spain's economic crisis.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer\n\nView Images The Sau Reservoir, which used to cover the former town of Sant Rom\u00e0 de Sau, was created in 1962 after a dam was built near the Ter River.\n\nPhotograph by Edu Bayer", "summary": "Photograph by Edu Bayer\u201cDuring the civil war Catalonia was the Republican fortress and stronghold, and it was from there that the battle against Fascism was launched,\u201d says Worrall.\n\u201cDuring the civil war, the use of our native language was repressed.\nPhotograph by Edu BayerBayer and Serena set out to capture the essence of rural Catalonian \u201cmicrovillages,\u201d each with less than 500 inhabitants.\nMicrocatalonia is a testament to the deep cuts created by the civil war, which are not yet healed.\nPrime Minister Rajoy has said that if Catalonia declares independence then the central government will suspend the legislation that grants the region it\u2019s semi-independent status.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "Inside an Ancient Pagan Ritual That Makes Men Become Monsters", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/10/ancient-ritual-pagan-sardinia-monsters.html", "top_image_url": "https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/183/883/smpost_1507302340390.jpg", "date": "2017-10-06T16:04:30Z", "description": "An ancient ceremony in the heart of a wild country celebrates the rebirth of spring.", "authors": "Austa Somvichian-Clausen", "text": "Every Year, Men Turn Into Monsters for This Ancient Pagan Ritual Watch men from the small village of Mamoiada transform into the hideous beasts known as Mamuthones in this short film from the National Geographic Short Film Showcase.\n\nA mysterious, ancient tradition takes place each year in Mamoiada, a small village tucked into the middle of wild and mountainous Sardinia.

MIT physicist Rainer Weiss, co-winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics, was also born in Germany, joining the 35 percent of U.S. physics laureates who were born abroad.\n\nEvidence suggests that the globetrotting lifestyle itself spurs innovation. A study in Nature published October 4 suggests that scientists who moved around internationally are cited more widely than academics who stayed in the country where they published their first paper.\n\nOn average, today's science Nobel laureates are getting older.\n\nOf this year's laureates in medicine, physics, and chemistry, all but one are above the age of 70. That's reflective of a graying trend among laureates.

About a hundred years ago, there were only about a thousand physicists. Now, there are hundreds of thousands\u2014perhaps even a million\u2014worldwide, making the \u201cbreakthrough backlog\u201d that much larger with each passing year.\n\nThat said, novelists and economists have also grown in ranks, yet they aren't graying at the same rate as the sciences. In addition, the overall trend for the Nobel Peace Prize favors younger laureates. The Peace Prize claims the youngest-ever Nobel recipient: education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she co-won the prize in 2014.\n\nNobel laureates are overwhelmingly male.\n\nOut of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. In some disciplines, the drought has persisted for decades: The last woman to win a Nobel Prize for physics, Maria Goeppert Mayer, was honored in 1964. The gap reflects longtime institutional biases against women within the sciences, a lag exacerbated by the decades-long backlog of Nobel-worthy discoveries.\n\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains. Out of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women. Male Organization Female 1901 Marie Curie Physics, 1903 Chemistry, 1911 Curie is the only woman who has been honored twice, for her studies about radiation.

SOURCE: NOBELPRIZE.ORG\n\nNobel Museum curators told the BBC that they have no evidence of the committee refusing to give an award because a nominee was a woman. They also say that the committee slightly bent prize rules to ensure that Marie Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics. But that may come as small consolation for the supremely qualified female scientists who were never recognized.\n\nFor instance, Lise Meitner, one of the co-discoverers of nuclear fission, was nominated for the physics prize 29 times from 1937 to 1965 and the chemistry prize an additional 19 times from 1924 to 1948, according to Nobel Foundation archival records. She never won. And while astronomer Vera Rubin's groundbreaking work revealing the existence of dark matter received wide acclaim, she died on December 25, 2016, with no Nobel to call her own. (Read National Geographic's obituary for Vera Rubin.)\n\nView Images Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist who studied nuclear fission, died in 1968. According to the official rules, Nobel Prizes can't be awarded after death.\n\nPhotograph by Corbis, Getty\n\nIncreasingly, Nobel laureates represent much larger scientific collaborations.\n\nNobel Foundation rules say that a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to up to three individuals, reflective of the small-team science that prevailed in the early 20th century. But today, major breakthroughs increasingly come from massive scientific collaborations, and the Nobel Committee has been reticent to award science prizes to broader groups.\n\nThe contrast is especially stark in physics, where scientific collaborations can include thousands of researchers\u2014as illustrated by the breakthrough that earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. The prize went to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish for detecting gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\nWhile the trio's contributions were huge, they themselves argue that the prize should have recognized the broader LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which includes hundreds of scientists. After all, the study that announced the detection of gravitational waves has 1,011 co-authors, by Popular Science's count. Just 0.3 percent of them were honored by name in Stockholm.\n\n\"We live in an era where some huge discoveries are really the result of giant collaborations, with major contributions coming from very large numbers of people,\" Thorne says in an interview posted on the Nobel Prize's website.", "summary": "Out of the 881 individuals who won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.\nFemale Nobel laureates Organization While the number of women awarded Nobel Prizes has increased through the years, a significant gender gap still remains.\nOut of 881 individuals who have won Nobel Prizes between 1901 and 2016, only 48 have been women.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "World's Best Museums", "url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/lists/activities/best-museums-in-world.html", "top_image_url": "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/travel/2017-digital/must-see-museums/design-museum-london-united-kingdom.jpg", "date": "2017-10-06T12:11:46Z", "description": "Get inspired in these creative and engaging museums from South Africa to San Francisco.", "authors": "Alexandra E.

Ideally, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to implement extreme solutions but for that not to happen things would have to be changed.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of people gathered across Spain earlier on Saturday as Catalonia prepared to declare independence from the rest of the country, many dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse Spain\u2019s worst political crisis for decades.\n\nThe Catalan authorities say around 90 percent of those who voted supported a split from Spain. Madrid says secession is illegal under the Spain\u2019s 1978 constitution. Residents of Catalonia who oppose secession largely boycotted the vote.\n\nThe crisis is a political test for Rajoy, who has been uncompromising. Some 900 people were injured during the vote when police tried to disrupt voting, firing rubber bullets and charging crowds with truncheons.\n\nThe political stand-off has divided the country, pushed banks and companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and shaken market confidence in the Spanish economy, prompting calls from the European Commission for Catalan and Spanish leaders to find a political solution.\n\n\u201cI hope that the Catalonia that makes pacts, is moderate and for many years contributed to Spain\u2019s economic growth and improvement in welfare and wealth returns.

Many locals say they are seeing none of the proceeds.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t give us that 175 million rand ($13 million), we are going to shut down the mine,\u201d said Chippa Langa, a leader of the community around the Mogalakwena platinum mine, referring to a community fund set up by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) (AMSJ.J).\n\nTo avoid such an outcome, a leading human rights lawyer is negotiating with the local royal house to allow community representatives more control over the fund.\n\n\u201cWe are renegotiating the agreement to make it more accountable,\u201d said the lawyer, Richard Spoor, whose work has included spearheading a class action suit against gold producers over the fatal lung disease silicosis which miners contract.\n\nIt is a plan that, if copied elsewhere, would dilute the power of the tribal leaders and could do the same to the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994.\n\nBut Spoor says he and his legal team, who are acting for the communities rather than the mine, are not undermining tradition.\n\n\u201cOur view is that this more democratic model is far more aligned with traditional law and custom.

From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.\n\n\u201cHe went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that\u2019s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn\u2019t there,\u201d the younger Mr. Paddock said. \u201cHe went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn\u2019t there either. He went to real estate and that\u2019s where the money was.\u201d\n\nStephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, \u201cwe had cash flow,\u201d said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of guy he was.

Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.\n\n\u201cHe acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,\u201d said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.\n\nMr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and \u201cuppity about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cHe seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.\u201d\n\nMr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot\u2019s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.\n\n\u201cThis guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,\u201d said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.\n\nEven in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.\n\n\u201cIf Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cHe did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Most Boring\u2019 Son\n\nMr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.\n\n\u201cMy brother was the most boring one in the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said. \u201cHe was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it\u2019s like, who?\u201d\n\nTheir father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a \u201cglib, smooth talking \u2018confidence man,\u2019 who is egotistic and arrogant.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who \u201chas been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.\n\nThe boys\u2019 mother raised them alone on a secretary\u2019s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.\n\n\u201cShe kept that secret from the family,\u201d Patrick Paddock said.\n\nStephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.\n\nMr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence. He didn\u2019t always stay between the lines.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.\n\n\u201cEverybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,\u201d Mr. Alarcon said. \u201cHe had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn\u2019t care what it took.\u201d\n\nA Knack for Making Money\n\nMr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not \u201cTaj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCrucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.\n\nHe was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants\u2019 complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.\n\nMr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. \u201cWhat you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.\n\nThough Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\n\n\u201cHe was a tough negotiator,\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cHe wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.\u201d\n\nThe House Advantage\n\nBy the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock\u2019s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe likes it when people go, \u2018Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?\u201d Eric Paddock said.\n\nGambling made him feel important, if not social.\n\n\u201cYou could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. \u201cHe liked everyone doting on him.\u201d\n\nHe sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.\n\nA couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock\u2019s gambling history.\n\nThe analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.\n\nPlaying a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.\n\nOne of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of \u201cGambling Wizards: Conversations With the World\u2019s Greatest Gamblers.\u201d A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often \u201clock\u201d a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.\n\nFor one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, \u201cbut he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Paddock \u201cknew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.\n\nHe was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Absent Neighbor\n\nMr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.\n\nColleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock\u2019s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.\n\nHe did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.\n\nWhen he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking. \u201cHe said nothing,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cNot a word. No eye contact.\u201d\n\nEven more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone has a reaction to Trump,\u201d said Mr. McKay\u2019s wife, Darlene.\n\nMs. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: \u201cHe always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock\u2019s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.\n\nIt is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.\n\nMr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.\n\nHis neighbors added personal touches to their yards \u2014 decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock\u2019s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.\n\nMs. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.\n\nSeveral days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.\n\nMs. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.", "summary": "Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways.\nMr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with \u201ca kind of irreverence.\nThough Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually \u2014 Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit \u2014 Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.\nMr. McKay said hello and yelled out, \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Mr. Paddock kept walking.\nThe message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.", "score": 0.0}, {"source": "the-new-york-times", "title": "As Overdose Deaths Pile Up, a Medical Examiner Quits the Morgue", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/drug-overdose-medical-examiner.html", "top_image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/26/us/00medicalexaminer1/00medicalexaminer1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "date": "2017-10-08T04:55:08Z", "description": "\u201cIt has completely overwhelmed us,\u201d Dr. Thomas A.

Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O\u2019Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.\n\nIn a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I\u2019m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to \u201cdeal with this issue head on.\u201d\n\nI am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10. \u0097 From Lauren O\u2019Connor\u2018s memo\n\nLisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that \u201che denies many of the accusations as patently false.\u201d In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo were \u201coff base\u201d and that they had parted on good terms.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, \u201cmy motto is to keep the peace.\u201d\n\nMs. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d She said she had \u201cexplained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Ms. O\u2019Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women\u2019s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with \u201cvulnerable women who hope he will get them work.\u201d\n\nThe allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d to the television show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.\n\nIn 2015, the year Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem\u2019s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women\u2019s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, it seemed golden \u2014 the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,\u201d said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. \u201cBut behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s treatment of women.\n\nDozens of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.\n\nMr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its \u201cbusiness reputation\u201d or \u201cany employee\u2019s personal reputation,\u201d a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.\n\nCharles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not evidence of anything.\u201d\n\nI am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished. \u0097 From Lauren O\u2019Connor\u2018s memo\n\nAt Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the wake of Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein\u2019s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O\u2019Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.\n\n\u201cThe parties made peace very quickly,\u201d Ms. Bloom said.\n\nThrough her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O\u2019Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. \u201cI am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cBut remaining silent is causing me great distress.\u201d\n\nIn speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, \u201cWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it\u2019s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\u201d\n\nA Common Narrative\n\nMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein\u2019s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.\n\n\u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,\u201d one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. \u201cShe was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or skill set.\u201d The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management\u2019s attention through other employees.\n\nAcross the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPhoto\n\nWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing \u201cturndown duty\u201d late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.\n\nIn interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly \u2014 meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. \u201cIt was so manipulative,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou constantly question yourself \u2014 am I the one who is the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.\n\nMost women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.\n\nMs. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. \u201cWe were so young at the time,\u201d said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.\n\nBut in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern \u2014 young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels \u2014 have accumulated for almost three decades?\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret to the inner circle,\u201d said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein\u2019s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.\n\nSpeaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O\u2019Connor would be better off marrying a \u201cfat, rich Jewish\u201d man because she was probably just good for \u201cbeing a wife\u201d and \u201cmaking babies,\u201d she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.\n\nSteve Hutensky, one of Miramax\u2019s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.\n\nMs. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.\n\nMonths after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.\n\n\u2018Coercive Bargaining\u2019\n\nFor actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and popular attractions like the \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in \u201cChicago\u201d to Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cSilver Linings Playbook.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller \u201cKiss the Girls\u201d all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.\n\nMr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\u201d Ms. Judd said. \u201cIt was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.\u201d\n\nTo get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling \u201cpanicky, trapped,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.\u201d\n\nNot long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with \u201cVariety\u201d without naming the man involved.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was \u201cnot to be construed as an admission\u201d by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to \u201cavoid litigation and buy peace,\u201d according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film \u201cScream\u201d and would later star in the television show \u201cCharmed.\u201d She declined to comment.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nIncreased Scrutiny\n\nJust months before Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.\n\nSoon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.\n\nIn March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.\n\nThe claims were taken up by the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office later declined to bring charges.\n\nBut Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.\n\nMs. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.\n\nThen Ms. O\u2019Connor\u2019s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, \u201cThe balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.\u201d\n\nShe was a valued employee \u2014 Mr. Weinstein described her as \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201ca great person,\u201d \u201ca brilliant executive\u201d \u2014 so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O\u2019Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.\n\n\u201cBecause this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo.

Women accused him of requesting massages, appearing naked in front of them and asking if they wanted to watch him shower, among other behaviors.

The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly \u2014 and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller\u2019s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.\n\nDonald F.

Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.\n\nOthers doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime.

While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel.

Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.\n\nBut White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.\n\nOne sign of the White House\u2019s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.\n\nEven as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.\n\nBut lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.\n\nThe White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters.

But the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, wanted to make one thing clear: Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t just teasing his favorite antagonists. He was sending a message.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that he\u2019s messing with the press,\u201d Ms. Sanders told reporters. \u201cI think we have some serious world issues here. I think that North Korea, Iran both continue to be bad actors, and the president is somebody who\u2019s going to always look for ways to protect Americans, and he\u2019s not going to dictate what those actions may look like.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Mr. Trump\u2019s preprandial banter took on an ominous tone.

Or perhaps he was predicting a clash with Iran, a week before he is expected to disavow the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to lay out his game plan for our enemies,\u201d Ms. Sanders declared.\n\nSometimes, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements leave his own staff in the dark, forcing them to impute a meaning to his words that might not actually exist. Privately, a few aides said they did not believe the president was preparing the country for war with either North Korea or Iran.\n\nBut they also noted Ms. Sanders has had a more successful debut as press secretary than her predecessor, Sean Spicer, in part because she has not attempted to clean up Mr. Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 something that would rankle the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d The Justice Department later said there was no evidence that Mr. Obama tapped his apartment during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPressed by reporters at the time, Mr. Spicer tried to walk back the claim, saying \u201cthe president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also shows an obvious delight in keeping people guessing. At the United Nations last month, he announced he had made up his mind about how to handle the Iran nuclear deal, but was not going to tell the public. When he met Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, perhaps America\u2019s closest ally, she asked him what he had decided. He refused to tell her, either.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say today he\u2019s made a decision,\u201d a bemused Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said at the time. \u201cI knew he had, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to say he had.\u201d\n\nHenry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is credited with coining the principle of constructive ambiguity in diplomacy: the use of deliberately fuzzy language to overcome sensitive issues in negotiations between countries. Mr. Trump may have tried a variation of that on Thursday evening, except that he was applying it to military deterrence.\n\nIn his prepared remarks to the military leaders, Mr. Trump outlined a series of specific challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have had challenges that we really should have taken care of a long time ago, like North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, ISIS and the revisionist powers that threaten our interests all around the world,\u201d the president said, using the an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nWhat made Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d particularly tantalizing was the timing.\n\nFor weeks, he has promised to retaliate against any North Korean aggression toward the United States. When Mr. Tillerson spoke in Beijing last week about seeking diplomatic channels to the North, Mr. Trump followed up with a tweet that his chief diplomat was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d the president\u2019s nickname for the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.\n\nMr. Trump also faces an Oct. 15 deadline to recertify the nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated among world powers during the Obama administration. He is expected to decline to recertify the agreement, which would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it is equally plausible that Mr. Trump was merely being theatrical, using the backdrop of military officers to stir up some drama. As the president spoke, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Paul J. Selva, stood next to him stoically.\n\nPerhaps it is not Mr. Kissinger, but his former boss, Richard M. Nixon, who is the president\u2019s model. Nixon devised the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of statecraft, under which he hoped to keep the nation\u2019s foes off balance by persuading them that he was impulsive and unpredictable.\n\nAsked whether Mr. Trump had adopted Nixon\u2019s keep-\u2018em-guessing approach, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, is the president trying to do that? Absolutely. I mean, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Trump, he seemed to savor the speculation.

But the mandate ensnarled the federal government in more than five years of litigation, which overshadowed many other aspects of the health care law.\n\nThe rules issued on Friday prompted more lawsuits and threats of lawsuits. The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, and the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, filed lawsuits to block the new rules, which took effect immediately.\n\nBoth said the rules violated the First Amendment, which bars government action \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d\n\nBut some conservatives and religious groups said the new rules would allow them to live out their religious beliefs. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin hailed the rules as \u201ca landmark day for religious liberty.\u201d The rules were also welcomed by groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns who had resisted the Obama administration\u2019s mandate because, they said, it would make them \u201cmorally complicit in grave sin.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe new administration isn\u2019t going to force Catholic nuns to provide contraceptives,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represents the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a long, divisive culture war because the last administration decided nuns needed to give out contraceptives.\u201d\n\nThe new initiatives came a day after Mr. Sessions changed the Justice Department\u2019s position on a related issue: whether a ban on workplace discrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 encompasses discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The Obama administration had adopted the view that it does cover transgender people, but Mr. Sessions said the department should take the position in court that it does not.\n\nMr. Sessions\u2019s guidance issued on Friday directs federal agencies to review their regulations with an eye to expanding their protections for religious believers. Conservative religious individuals and organizations have objected for years to nondiscrimination laws that have affected whom they can hire and fire, whom they can serve and how they can operate. The new directive affords them far broader latitude.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn issuing the new directive, Mr. Sessions reinterpreted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was adopted by Congress in 1993 with broad support from across the religious spectrum. It says the government could limit the free exercise of religion only if there was a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason, and must do so in the least restrictive way possible.\n\nAmong the possible results of the guidance, legal directors at liberal advocacy groups said, religious charities or schools that receive government funding could fire an unmarried employee who becomes pregnant, or an employee who marries a same-sex partner. Religious contractors that administer foster care programs could refuse to place foster children with gay couples, even in states that have nondiscrimination laws.\n\nHouses of worship that have been damaged in hurricanes could receive grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild \u2014 even if they are using the taxpayer funds to hire only staff members who share their religious beliefs, rather than making the positions open to all.\n\nIn addition, David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, said that clerks with the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs who do not agree with same-sex marriage could refuse, under this guidance, to process paperwork to provide benefits to a widow in a same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sweeping expansion of religious discrimination by the federal government, and we think it goes beyond where federal law is,\u201d he said.\n\nVanita Gupta, a top civil rights lawyer at the Justice Department during the Obama administration, said: \u201cThe freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it is not an absolute right. It cannot be used as a shield to permit discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, just as federal courts a half century ago denied the ability of businesses and employers to use their religious beliefs as a basis to discriminate against African-Americans.\u201d She also called the new contraception policy \u201ca direct attack on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said the new rules on contraception were \u201ca resounding victory for true-believing Americans.\u201d They will, she said, end the \u201cpersecution of ordinary Americans who for years have been seeking only the freedom to live in accordance with their faith, free from government interference.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Katskee, the legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group that plans to challenge the rules in court, said they imposed an impermissible burden on female employees who want cost-free contraceptive coverage and may be unable to get it.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is the right to believe and worship as you see fit,\u201d Mr. Katskee said. \u201cIt\u2019s never the right to use government to impose costs, burdens or harms on other people. You can\u2019t use the government to make other people pay the price for your religious beliefs or practices.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday also notified health insurance companies that it would vigorously enforce provisions of the Affordable Care Act regulating coverage of abortion services. The health department reminded insurers that if they cover abortion, they generally cannot use federal funds for that purpose, but must collect separate payments from consumers and must deposit the money in special accounts used exclusively for coverage of abortion services.\n\nUnder the new rules, exemptions to the contraceptive coverage mandate would be available to many kinds of employers, including publicly traded companies that said they had religious objections to covering some or all types of contraception.\n\nThe Trump administration said that some people would, as a result of the new rules, not receive \u201ccoverage or payments for contraceptive services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s legitimate interests in providing for contraceptive coverage do not require us to violate sincerely held religious beliefs\u201d or moral convictions, the administration said.
